The use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction has been reported to offer significant potential benefits, such as preserving the hamstring tendons. However, its effects on the ankle must be considered prior to surgery. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study evaluating ankle morbidity using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, plantarflexion and eversion strength, and Clarke's angle on both extremities. Data were collected from patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test with SPSS v.26. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included, with the mean AOFAS scores of 58.88 (donor side) and 70.12 (contralateral side). Mann-Whitney test results showed no significant difference in AOFAS scores between the two sides (p=0.085). The mean plantarflexion strength values were 62.23 (donor) and 66.77 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.489). Additionally, the mean Clarke's angle values were 59.10 (donor) and 69.90 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.099).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate ankle performance following PLT harvest for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed by searching five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Inclusion criteria included: ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft, ≥6-month follow-up, and validated ankle outcomes (American Orthopaedic Foot And Ankle Society [AOFAS]/Foot and Ankle Disability Index [FADI] scores). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models using R software (version 4.4.3). Heterogeneity was assessed via I² statistics, and risk of bias was evaluated using JBI checklists. RESULTS: Twenty articles (1024 patients) were identified, comprising eleven prospective cohort studies and nine randomised clinical trials (RCT), based on title, abstract, and quality assessments. Meta-analysis demonstrated excellent postoperative ankle function, with pooled AOFAS scores of 96.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.6-99.3) at 6 months, 96.1 (93.9-98.2) at 12 months, and 97.2 (93.9-100.6) at 24 months. FADI scores similarly improved to 97.4 (96.0-98.9) by 6 months and 99.4 (98.7-100.1) at 24 months. Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age and AOFAS outcomes (β = -0.23, p = 0.36). Minor complications (e.g., transient hypaesthesia) occurred in 13%-23% of patients but resolved within months. No studies reported major nerve injuries or ankle instability. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields minimal donor-site morbidity, with consistently high AOFAS/FADI scores across all age groups. These findings support the safety of PLT autografts, though heterogeneity is evident, and the predominance of male participants and the regional focus of studies, mainly Asian populations, may affect generalisability.

Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). STUDY DESIGN: Case series, Level of evidence 4. METHODS: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023.The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded. RESULTS: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively).

However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. METHODS: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8 mm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10 mm with a graft tube, compression to 9 mm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. RESULTS: Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95 % CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608 N (SD: 233.12; 95 % CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037). Group 0 (native 8 mm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341 N (SD: 936.67; 95 % CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (p = 0.196). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9 mm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8 mm grafts.",2025-08,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,346-350,,,66,,J Orthop,Effect of diameter reduction by compression on peroneus longus allograft integrity,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40765794 PMCID: PMC12320093,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40765794,,Allograft; Anterior cruciate ligament; Compressed graft; Graft diameter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main mechanism of injury is usually when a pivoting injury occurs in which the tibia is translated anteriorly. At the same time, the knee is in a slight valgus and flexed attitude, and is predominantly found in contact sports like soccer. The variable symptoms that warrant medical attention usually include pain, swelling, knee giving way, difficulty ambulating, and reduced knee range of motion. The treatment usually depends on the patient's symptomatology, type of injury, the growth remaining in his or her growth plates, and activity goals. The purpose of the study is to determine the superior treatment modality for ACL injury in patients older than 40 years. Methodology The study was a prospective study conducted in the orthopedic outpatient department of a tertiary care center in northern India. A total of 60 patients were included in the study sample. Patients were divided into two treatment groups: Group A (n=30), consisting of conservatively managed patients, and Group B (n=30), consisting of surgically managed patients. Various symptoms during presentation were also noted in the study, which showed pain and instability as the predominant symptoms on presentation. Treatment modalities for ACL injury in our study include conservative management by physiotherapy and surgical management with ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus autograft. The physiotherapy protocol and post-surgery rehabilitation protocol were kept the same to compare the outcome in both groups. The Lysholm knee scoring scale was used to calculate the functional outcome of conservatively and surgically managed groups before intervention and post-intervention at the first, third, sixth, and twelfth months. The data was collected and summarized in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and analyzed with IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., using the ANOVA test, chi-square test, and paired t-test. A p-value of < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. Results The study was conducted with two groups (group A: conservative; group B: surgical group) with comparable demographic profiles and slight male predominance, comparing the functional outcome of surgically and conservatively managed middle-aged patients with ACL injuries. The Lysholm knee scoring scale showed a poor pre-intervention score in both groups. This subsequently improved over a period of one year of study for both groups. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score of 75.80±5.95 (group A) and 96.13±2.65 (group B), with a p-value of < 0.001, was noted, which showed a significantly superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population. Conclusions Sixty patients over 40 years of age were taken up for the study, with more than two-thirds of the study population being male. The study showed the pre-intervention Lysholm knee scoring scale for both groups to be ""poor."" The score remained ""poor"" even after the first month post-intervention. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score with an ""excellent"" outcome was noted in the surgical group (group B), which depicted an overall superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population.",2025-05,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,e84489,,5,17,,Cureus,Comparison of Surgical and Non-Surgical Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Middle-Aged Population,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40539191 PMCID: PMC12178572,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\P6P9T3WW\Kumar et al.

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is a promising autograft for ACL reconstruction, with less donor site morbidity than traditional grafts like bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring tendons. This study evaluates donor site ankle morbidity after PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study at an Indian Government Medical College and Hospital from February 2023 to October 2024 involved 56 patients with symptomatic ACL tears who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using PLT grafts. Donor site morbidity was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using the visual analog scale for foot and ankle (VAS-FA) and American orthopaedic Foot and Ankle society (AOFAS) scores at 14 days, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Data were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 36.8 years and an average injury duration of 13.3 months. Donor site morbidity occurred in 66.1% of patients, mainly as mild pain and swelling, which improved significantly over time. VAS-FA scores dropped from 7.52 preoperatively to 2.05 at 6 months, and AOFAS scores increased from 54.8 to 80.0. Chronic injury duration (over 16 months) was associated with poorer recovery, while preoperative pain, gender, graft size, and weight-bearing duration had no significant impact on recovery outcomes. CONCLUSION: PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction leads to minimal donor site morbidity, with mild pain and swelling that improve over time. PLT grafts offer a promising alternative to traditional autografts, providing comparable outcomes and fewer complications. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results.",2025-06,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,207-212,,6,15,,J Orthop Case Rep,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40520747 PMCID: PMC12159622,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40520747,,American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; peroneus longus tendon; visual analog scale for foot and ankle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report examines a case of MLKI and the outcomes of a staged surgical approach to repair and reconstruct the affected knee ligaments. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old female sustained a multi-ligament injury to her right knee after a twisting event, resulting in pain, swelling, and instability. The patient underwent a two-stage arthroscopic reconstruction, beginning with repair of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner structures, followed by anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Autografts, including the bilateral peroneus longus and contralateral hamstrings, were used for the procedure. Her rehabilitation protocol emphasized early passive range of motion exercises, with delayed weight-bearing to promote effective healing. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the successful restoration of knee stability and function following a two-stage surgical approach to MLKI.

However, concerns remain regarding long-term functional impairments of the foot and ankle after harvesting a full-thickness PLT. PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term donor site morbidity in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a PLT autograft. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with harvested PLT autografts, and all eligible patients were invited to participate in a clinical examination at the hospital. To evaluate their range of motion, all included patients underwent a physical examination. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). To evaluate foot and ankle structural changes, the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), arc height index (AHI), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (LTFMA), calcaneal pitch angle (CPA), and metatarsal angle (MA) were measured in the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients who were available for the final follow-up were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the final follow-up was 45.7 ± 9.5 years. The mean follow-up time was 19.5 ± 3.4 years. AOFAS scores were excellent in 92.3% of patients (n = 24) and good in 7.7% (n = 2). The mean FAAM-ADL score was 99.6 ± 1.86. The mean FAAM-S score was 98.1 ± 5.94. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side for any of the measured parameters-including the IMA, HVA, AHI, LTFMA, CPA, and MA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated good to excellent long-term patient-reported outcomes and negligible radiographic changes after harvesting the full thickness PLT compared with the contralateral side. These long-term data strongly support PLT harvesting as an alternative graft choice and suggest that this method does not alter the natural history of foot and ankle structures.",2025-04,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,2.32597E+16,,4,13,,Orthop J Sports Med,Harvesting the Full Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Is Not Associated With Structural Foot Impairments,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40297044 PMCID: PMC12035389,,; C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\5J3SF3AD\Velioğlu et al.

A recent systematic review shows it is a safe and reproducible technique with low morbidity of donor sites (1). The method for PL harvest routinely involves tenodesis of the PL stump to the peroneus brevis (PB). To the authors' best knowledge, no study exists in the literature that has compared the outcomes of tenodesis versus no tenodesis on post-operative ankle functional outcome scores. The purpose of the present study is to assess the importance of tenodesis on post-operative ankle scores. METHODS: A total of 200 consecutive patients from July 2022 to November 2022 were included in the study: 72 in the no tenodesis group and 128 in the tenodesis group. Institutional ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics review committee before the initiation of the study. Demographic variables (age, gender and level of play) were recorded. Pre-operative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) and Functional Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were calculated for both groups and compared with post-operative scores at six weeks, three months, six months and one-year follow-up. RESULTS: For the entire study population (n = 200), we found that AOFAS and FADI scores showed no significant difference at any interval except for lower scores at six weeks of follow-up for both groups compared to baseline. We found that the no tenodesis group had slightly better AOFAS and FADI scores at the six-week follow-up, which were statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, the magnitude of variance (0.13 and 0.20, respectively) was too small to be clinically significant. Age, gender and level of play had no impact on ankle functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Tenodesis of the PL to the PB has been the standard norm in PL graft harvest for various ligament surgeries. The present high-powered prospective cohort study shows that tenodesis.does not improve ankle functional outcome scores compared to no tenodesis. Further work is needed to assess the impact of tenodesis or no tenodesis on ankle biomechanics (eversion, plantarflexion and gait).

This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length ≥ 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump ≥ 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. RESULTS: In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length ≥ 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.",4/24/2025,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,175,,1,25,,BMC Surg,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40269891 PMCID: PMC12020297,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\3UX4DIMQ\Chen et al.

Choosing the appropriate graft and determining the surgical treatment staging by assessing the likelihood of doing the most anatomical revision canals and placing them with the primary canals before surgery are crucial factors affecting treatment outcomes. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in the patient-reported functional outcomes in revision ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autografts in a single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients who were eligible for follow-up among 25 surgeries performed between 2015 and 2023 were included in this retrospective analysis and met the inclusion criteria. The patient reported functional outcome, Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity level, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain before the injury and during the most recent follow-up. The peroneus longus (PL) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) groups' patient-reported results were assessed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two revision groups with PL and BPTB autograft in terms of age, sex, duration between injury and surgery, concurrent injuries, and isolated or complex surgeries. There was not a significant difference between the groups' pre-injury patient-reported outcomes, including the Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity, and VAS for pain (n.s.). There was not a significant difference in the two groups' functional results at follow-up, although both groups' functional outcomes improved and all patients recovered to their pre-injury activity level. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings suggest that graft options (peroneus longus and BTB) and surgical complexities (isolated and complex revision) yield comparable functional outcomes for most measures. However, notable differences in post-operative pain levels warrant further exploration. These results underscore the effectiveness of both graft types and surgical techniques in achieving satisfactory recovery while acknowledging the necessity of customized approaches to pain management based on individual patient circumstances.",2025-04,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,221-228,,4,15,,J Orthop Case Rep,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40212520 PMCID: PMC11981519,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40212520,,anterior cruciate ligament; Autograft; bone-patellar tendon-bone; peroneus longus; revision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0-120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. DISCUSSION: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. CONCLUSION: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation. Simultaneous reconstruction reduces hospital stays, anaesthesia exposure, and surgical risks while streamlining rehabilitation, enabling quicker patient recovery and improved outcomes.",2025-04,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,111150,,,129,,Int J Surg Case Rep,Management of a complex multiligament knee injury,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40106956 PMCID: PMC11964545,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40106956,,Graft; Hamstring; Harvesting; Multiligament knee injuries; Peroneus longus tendon; Posterior meniscus root tears; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18-20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group.

Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and stability of the knee compared with conservative management. Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR.

ACL injuries are common, often leading to knee instability and subsequent complications. ACL reconstruction is a standard treatment option, with various autograft sources available. The anterior half of the peroneus longus (AHPL) tendon has emerged as a potential alternative autograft. This study aimes to examine the anterior knee pain in ACL reconstruction using AHPL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 51 patients with ACL injuries undergoing ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft. Patient demographics, surgical details, and Kujala scores were collected. RESULTS: The average age of our participants was 25.88 ± 5.39 years, with mean BMI classified as obese. Significant improvements in Kujala and KOOS pain scores were observed between each data collection. There was a negative correlation between baseline and three and six months post-operatively Kujala and KOOS pain scores with BMI. DISCUSSION: The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft significantly reduced anterior knee pain, as indicated by a better Kujala and KOOS pain score. Previous studies have highlighted concerns regarding anterior knee pain with other autograft sources, such as the patellar and hamstring tendons. The AHPL tendon autograft offers a promising alternative with favorable anterior knee pain and minimal donor site morbidity.

Altered kinematics might lead to changes in muscle loading, potentially affecting the energy demand of locomotion. Understanding alterations in muscle mechanics and energetics during landing could enhance the rehabilitation program design. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the muscle mechanics and energetics of individuals with CAI, copers, and healthy controls during single leg jump landing. Three groups, CAI, copers, and healthy individuals (total n = 66), performed the landing task, and data on 3D motion capture, ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activation were simultaneously collected. A musculoskeletal model was applied to estimate muscle force and mechanical power. Compared to healthy groups, individuals with CAI showed increased peak muscle forces in the gluteus maximus (p < 0.001), gluteus medius (p < 0.001), vastus lateralis (p < 0.001), and peroneus longus (p < 0.001) during landing.

Additionally, negative mechanical power redistribution in CAI shifted from the ankle to the hip (p < 0.001), while copers exhibited a similar redistribution from the ankle to the knee (p < 0.05). This study suggested that both CAI and copers exhibit biomechanical modifications in proximal joints. Copers showed a novel landing strategy aimed for enhancing landing stability, but with the risk of ACL injury. The identified energy redistribution observed in both CAI and copers could potentially contribute to the recurrent ankle sprains.

The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ± 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ± 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ± 3.9 (range = 85-100). CONCLUSION: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

There are different types of grafts used, and the choice depends on several factors. Autologous grafts, from the patients themselves, are the most common option, with rapid incorporation and a lower failure rate. Allografts from donors have their role in specific cases. Synthetic grafts, used in the 1980s, have advantages such as the absence of morbidity at the donor site, but studies have shown long-term complications. Hybrid grafts, combining autologous grafts and allografts, have gained interest, allowing a larger diameter and reducing morbidity. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has received attention, with positive results, good knee function and less hypotrophy of the thigh at the donor site. Autologous quadriceps tendon graft has gained popularity, with results comparable to patellar and flexor tendon grafts, lower morbidity at the donor site and a lower rate of re-rupture. The choice of graft has evolved, with autologous flexor grafts being preferred for less active patients and patellar grafts with bone fragments for high-performance athletes. Allografts, synthetic and hybrid grafts have their role in specific circumstances. The choice must be based on scientific evidence, considering advantages and disadvantages.

STUDY DESIGN: Dogs with partial CCL rupture that underwent a unilateral TPLO were included. The population was divided into two groups: remnant CCL transected (study group) and left in situ (control group). Preoperative and 6-week postoperative measurements of PLT, in three specific locations, and patellar ligament length (PLL) were collected. Risk factors for PLT and shortening were also included. RESULTS: Fifty-two dogs (56 stifles) with partial CCL rupture were retrospectively included. Twenty-nine stifles (51.8%) had the remnant CCL transected (study group) and 27 stifles (48.2%) had the remnant CCL left in situ (control group). Significant differences were found on PLT measurements between pre- and 6-week post-surgery for all three ligament locations with greatest difference at the middle region. Median PLL was significantly shorter 6-week post-surgery for both groups. No significant differences in PLT nor PLL were identified between procedures where the remnant was transected or not. CONCLUSION: This study did not identify a protective effect of transecting the CCL remnant on PLT or patellar ligament shortening, contrary to other reports within the literature.

Peroneus longus (PL) grafts have garnered much attention recently due to ease of harvest and more reliable graft diameters. The present study aimed to study various anthropometric parameters associated with PL-graft diameters. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 50 patients undergoing PL harvest for ACL surgery at a tertiary referral hospital. Age, gender, height, weight, length of the lower leg (lateral tibial plateau to the tip of the fibula), circumference at the head of the fibula and girth at the lateral malleolus were measured pre-operatively. The length of the graft doubled and tripled graft diameters were assessed intra-operatively. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the association between the pre-operative anthropometric variables and the intra-operative graft diameters and length of graft harvested. RESULTS: The mean doubled and tripled PL-graft diameter in our study population was 7.7 ± 0.9 mm and 8.7 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. The mean length of the graft was 25.9 ± 3.5 cm. We found no significant correlation between graft diameters and age, gender or height of the patient. We found that the patient's weight significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with graft diameter. We also found that the length of the lower leg (p < 0.0001), circumference at the head of the fibula (p = 0.001) and girth at the lateral malleolus (p = 0.029) showed significant correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter.

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using tripled or quadrupled PLT autograft (if graft thickness exceeded 10 mm then tripled) or quadrupled HT autograft. Patients were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24-month post-operatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean diameter of the PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of the HT autograft, and the mean graft harvesting time was less (P < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 36 days earlier than those in the HT group (P < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity, and better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between the groups in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Despite some donor site complications, such as numbness and infection, both PLT and HT grafts offer acceptable knee stability. However, PLT grafts seem to provide superior subjective functional outcomes based on patient-reported scores.

This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5 ± 2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8 ± 9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30° flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9 ± 26.9- 71.3 ± 11.5, p < 0.001) and Lysholm (59.9 ± 28.5-80.5 ± 11.2, p = 0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values. The foot function score AOFAS showed no significant impairment (100 ± 0-99.3 ± 2.5, p = 0.250). Complications included cyclops lesions of ACL reconstruction in three patients. CONCLUSION: At 1-year follow-up, MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft for patients simultaneously undergoing ACL reconstruction satisfactorily restores knee stability, has a low ACL reconstruction failure rate and does not significantly impair foot function.

This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. MATERIAL AND METHODS ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot &amp; Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. RESULTS There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56±0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44±0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46±3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48±4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain.

Anthropometric measurements were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), fibular length, calf circumference, and ankle circumference. The Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) was used to assess activity levels. PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using ultrasonography. Two-stranded PLT graft thickness was calculated using the previously reported formula by Luo et al. A thickness of less than 8 mm of PLT graft was accepted as an insufficient autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of two-stranded PLT graft thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to establish the best threshold values. RESULTS: Males had a significantly greater PLT CSA (0.17 ± 0.03 cm2) and predicted two-stranded PLT graft thickness (8.1 ± 0.6 mm) compared with females (0.15 ± 0.03 cm2 and 7.5 ± 0.6 mm, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Correlation analysis revealed that two-stranded PLT graft thickness positively correlated with height, weight, BMI, fibular length, calf circumference, ankle circumference, and Tegner Activity Scale in both genders, with stronger correlations observed in females. The logistic regression model identified height and calf circumference as significant predictors of sufficient two-stranded PLT graft thickness (≥ 8 mm) in males, while calf circumference and the TAS were significant predictors in females. ROC analysis demonstrated that calf circumference and the TAS had acceptable discriminatory abilities in females, with 36.25 cm and ≥ 4 cutoff points, respectively. However, no anthropometric variables in males exhibited strong discriminatory abilities for predicting two-stranded PLT graft thickness CONCLUSIONS: Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females. However, no anthropometric variables in males could be used strongly for prediction. These anthropometric measurements can assist in preoperative planning and decision-making, potentially improving ACLR outcomes by ensuring adequate graft thickness in females.

Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. HYPOTHESIS: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL-Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 ± 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged ≤25 years (P = .007). Neither donor age (≤40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P > .05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. CONCLUSION: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.",2024-08,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,2.32597E+16,,8,12,,Orthop J Sports Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 39135859 PMCID: PMC11318055,,; C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\CUKX5ZMM\Farey et al.

While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population. MATREIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients. RESULTS: 20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 ± 1.34 and 98.5 ± 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 ± 9.43 and 88.75 ± 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886±22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 ± 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio. CONCLUSION: While the use of peroneus longus tendon autografts in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction does not seem problematic on short-term subjective assessment, there is objective evidence in keeping with evertor weakness, weakness of first ray plantar flexion and possible ankle instability.

Many studies have investigated the efficacy of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and donor site morbidity has not been adequately studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using PLT were included. Ankle strengths of the patients evaluated with an analog dynamometer. Ankle range of motion (ROM) was measured with a smart phone inclonometer application. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the postoperative ankle strength(eversion, plantar flexion) in the donor area and the preoperative period (p=0.6 and p=0.7, respectively) and contralateral healthy side (p=0.6, p=0.6, respectively). Ankle ROM angles (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, inversion) were significantly lower in the post-operative period compared to the preoperative period and contralateral healthy side (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative AOFAS scores (p=0.2).

However, there are concerns regarding donor site morbidity. This study aims to compare the functional outcome of ACL reconstruction using hamstring (HT) and PLT autografts and evaluate the donor site morbidity. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (HT and PLT). Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Knee functional outcome was evaluated with IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores preoperatively, and postoperatively after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements, subjective evaluation of sensory disturbances, and ankle scoring with AOFAS and FADI scores. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, the PLT group showed comparable IKDC (p = 0.925) and Tegner-Lysholm (p = 0.600) scores with those of the HT group. The mean graft diameter in the PLT group (7.93 ± 0.52 mm) was larger compared with the HT group (7.43 ± 0.50 mm) (p < 0.001). The incidence of thigh atrophy (HT-16.7%, PLT-10%) and sensory disturbances (HT-73.3%, PLT-10%) was greater in the HT group. There was no significant ankle donor site morbidity in the PLT group (AOFAS-98.67 ± 3.45, FADI-99.23 ± 1.69). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction with PLT had comparable functional outcome with that of HT at 1 year. However, PLT demonstrated larger graft diameter, less donor site morbidity, and enhanced muscle recovery without significantly affecting the ankle function.

PURPOSE: To create an open-access data set on the morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of clinically important tendons and ligaments of the lower limb, using consistent methodologies, to enable direct tendon/ligament comparisons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nineteen distinct lower limb tendons and ligaments were retrieved from 8 fresh-frozen human cadavers (5 male, 3 female; aged 49-65 years) including Achilles, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, fibularis (peroneus) longus, fibularis (peroneus) brevis, flexor hallucis longus, extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, flexor digitorum longus, quadriceps, patellar, semitendinosus, and gracilis tendons; anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments; and 10 mm-wide grafts from the contralateral quadriceps and patellar tendons. Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSAUS], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression. RESULTS: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSAUS, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons. CONCLUSION: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties-key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models.

The choice of graft material in ACL reconstruction is crucial for optimal postoperative results, and this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the comparative efficacy of these two graft types. Method This open-label randomized comparative study involved a carefully selected cohort of patients undergoing single-bundle arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PL graft group or the hamstring graft group. Surgical procedures were conducted using standardized techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols were closely monitored. Functional outcomes, including range of motion, stability, and patient-reported measures, were assessed at predefined intervals to ensure comprehensive data collection. Results The study underscores significant demographic and clinical factors in ACL reconstruction outcomes. Participants were predominantly aged 17-30 years (58.33%) with a mean age of 29.27 years and exhibited a male predominance (80.56%). Common complaints included knee pain and instability, primarily due to falls from bikes (55.56%) or sports-related trauma (44.44%). Notably, PL grafts demonstrated advantages over hamstring grafts, with longer mean length (10.11 mm vs. 8.77 mm, p=0.0001) and shorter operation times. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner Lysholm scores show no significant differences between grafts over the period of time. There is no notable foot eversion weakness or significant donor site morbidity after the PL graft harvest. Hamstring graft cases exhibit a higher incidence of altered sensation and muscle atrophy, suggesting the potential benefits of PL grafts for improved surgical outcomes. Conclusions Graft comparisons favored PL grafts due to longer length, and functional outcome assessments between the two graft types. However, foot and ankle strength assessments revealed fluctuations in strength recovery with PL grafts, highlighting the need for tailored rehabilitation. Thigh circumference variations suggested potential muscle atrophy in the hamstring graft group, along with reported paresthesia in the ipsilateral proximal leg.

A human knee model study,Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery,,1434-3916,10.1007/s00402-024-05357-8,,"INTRODUCTION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains associated with the risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces. METHODS: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. RESULTS: The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation. CONCLUSION: This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.",2024-06,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,2703-2710,,6,144,,Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 38727813 PMCID: PMC11211157,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\PDR85BYJ\Blanke et al.

Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system-Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. RESULTS: One year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.",2024-06,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,1317-1326,,6,16,,Orthop Surg,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 38650179 PMCID: PMC11144498,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\K9D9PGBZ\Zhang et al.

Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft.

METHODS: Data from the Natural Corollaries and Recovery after ACL injury multicenter longitudinal cohort study were analyzed. Between May 2016 and October 2018, patients aged between 15 and 40 years, who had experienced an ACL tear within the last 6 weeks and sought medical attention at one of seven healthcare clinics in Sweden, were invited to participate. The mean time from injury to MRI was 19.6 ± 15.2 days. An orthopedic knee surgeon and a musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed all the MRI scans. The following structures were assessed: posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) complex, lateral collateral ligament (LCL), popliteus tendon, medial meniscus (MM), lateral meniscus (LM), and cartilage. In addition, the presence of bone bruising, impaction fractures in the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) or posterolateral tibia (PLT), and Segond fractures were also assessed.  RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (48.4% males) with a mean age of 25.4 ± 7.1 years were included.

The intricate coordination of joint movements relies heavily on the ACL's screw-home mechanism, a crucial element for synchronizing knee movement with neighboring joints. Despite its indispensable role, the ACL is susceptible to injury, necessitating surgical intervention. While many patients experience positive outcomes following ACL reconstruction surgeries, a significant proportion face the challenge of procedure failure. The key to success lies in the healing process within the tibial and femoral bone tunnels. The post-ACL reconstruction phase introduces its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of returning to sports (RTS), underscoring the importance of reinstating neuromuscular and motor function. The trajectory of rehabilitation is influenced by factors such as graft healing, patient age, gender, pain levels, and concurrent injuries. Materials and methods This prospective observational study spanned 2.5 years, enrolling 71 patients with diagnosed ACL injuries. Arthroscopic reconstruction utilized hamstring autografts and peroneus longus autografts. A nine-month post-surgery follow-up employed the Lysholm scoring system for comprehensive evaluations. Results Over 2.5 years, 87.3% of male and 12.6% of female participants underwent arthroscopic reconstruction. Lysholm scores revealed 28.1% excellent, 45.0% good, and 26.7% fair outcomes, with no participants in the unsatisfactory range. Lysholm scores demonstrated positive outcomes, indicating the efficacy of arthroscopic reconstruction in enhancing knee function. Findings align with existing literature, emphasizing positive results from ACL reconstruction techniques and specific implants. Comparisons with related studies highlight challenges in standardized return-to-sport guidelines and underscore the need for outcome measure standardization. Conclusion The study contributes nuanced insights into ACL reconstruction outcomes, emphasizing positive functional recovery trends at the nine-month follow-up. Lysholm scores indicate favorable outcomes, supporting the procedure's effectiveness. Consideration of specific implants adds practical value. Despite limitations, this study enriches ACL reconstruction research, promoting advancements in patient care and outcomes. Ongoing research with extended follow-ups and larger cohorts will enhance understanding and refine ACL reconstruction strategies.",2024-02,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,e53480,,2,16,,Cureus,Functional Outcomes in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 38440040 PMCID: PMC10910190,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\VTQGBZF4\Soni et al.

To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. METHODS: A single-center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. RESULTS: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/- 0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/- 0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre-op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre-op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre-op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre-op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/- 2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site.

In this study, the quadruple hamstring tendon (semitendinosus and gracilis) was measured in a sample of Iraqi adult males. The study enrolled 300 Iraqi men who underwent anterior cruciate ligament repair at Diwaniyah Teaching Hospital and Alforat Alawast Private Hospital between January 2020 and December 2021. The repair procedure was based on the utilization of the quadruple (gracilis and semitendinosus) hamstring tendon. The primary outcome measure was the size of the tendon, determined using a sizing tube calibrated to 0.5 mm. Out of the sample, 80% of patients had a graft diameter of 7.5 mm, while 15% had a graft diameter of 8 mm, and 5% had a diameter of 7 mm. Body mass index was a poor predictor of graft size, whereas patient height was an excellent predictor of graft diameter. The graft diameter in most Iraqi subjects with anterior cruciate ligament injuries needs to be five bands or even six bands; otherwise, other graft sources like bone-patellar-bone or peroneus longus tendon grafts should be considered.

This study aims to explore the changes in the ankle and gait after using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a reconstruction graft for the anterior cruciate ligament. METHODS: A total of 20 patients, 6 males and 14 females, aged 18 to 44 years, with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries, underwent reconstruction using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft between June 2021 and December 2021. The part on which the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was harvested was considered the experimental group, while the contralateral foot was the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups. RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P < 0.05).

Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts' biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozen + 21 kGy gamma irradiation, frozen + 21 kGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4 months) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at -80 °C. All groups were subject to 60 s static creep test with 250 N load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4 months) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam.

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

In this context, the peroneus longus tendon graft appears as an option to complement other grafts, transforming a thin quadruple graft into a sextuple graft. INDICATIONS: The sextuple graft technique for ACL reconstruction is used in patients who have a quadruple graft with a diameter of less than 8 mm, and due to its length, it is not possible to make a quintuple graft, for example. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: Initially, the hamstring tendons are removed with the aid of a tenotome. After that, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon is identified and removed. On the back table, the definitive graft is prepared so that we have a sextuple graft with a diameter greater than 8 mm. Finally, the ACL reconstruction is performed anatomically using an adjustable loop device in the femur and an interference screw in the tibia. RESULTS: In our experience with patients who have a hamstring graft diameter of less than 8 mm, we obtained an average increase of 1.8 mm in graft diameter when augmentation was performed with the anterior half of the peroneus longus. DISCUSSION: Grafts less than 8 mm in diameter are at increased risk of rupturing and failure of surgical treatment of the ACL injury. The surgeon must be prepared to make a quintuple or sextuple graft, but in some patients, the tendons are short or there is no availability of a tissue bank, making this practice impossible. The use of the anterior half of the peroneus longus to perform graft augmentation is safe, causing almost no morbidity to the donor area and is easily accessible during the procedure, making it an excellent option for increasing the diameter of thin grafts.

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and complications between revision ACLR using allografts and PLT autografts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who underwent arthroscopic revision of ACLR with complete clinical follow-ups between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Allograft was used in 44 of these patients, and PLT autograft was used in 15 of them. Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, Lachman, and anterior drawer tests were performed after a mean follow-up of 60months (range: 19-116). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to evaluate the donor ankle functions. Clinical outcomes and complications were compared between groups. RESULTS: Both groups showed significantly improved functional outcomes compared to their preoperative assessments. However, both groups had similar clinical results at the final follow-up, including Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity scale, knee range of motion, return to sports, time to return to daily activities, and rate of re-rupture. No major complications were seen in any of the patients. The AOFAS score was 99.13±2.64 in the PLT autograft group without loss of ankle muscle strength, deformity, instability, and permanent iatrogenic neurovascular injuries. The cumulative cost of the allograft group was significantly higher than the PLT autograft group. CONCLUSIONS: The PLT autograft might be an alternative autograft option to allografts due to similar clinical outcomes, low donor site morbidity, and reduced cost in ACLR revisions, especially if the primary ACLR was performed using grafts harvested around the knee.

Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women. METHODS: From June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals. RESULTS: PT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count.

The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (× 109/L), RBC (× 1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (× 109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33-15.24, 3.73-5.32, 10.33-13.95, 32.22-42.29, 169.66-413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99-15.55, 3.33-4.98, 9.71-13.17, 30.26-40.07, 172.34-372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22-14.14, 3.54-4.98, 9.80-13.97, 31.11-42.70, 151.30-417.14, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.

Therefore, researchers have explored other options, including the peroneus longus (PL) autograft. INDICATION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (both primary and revision), as well as multiligament reconstruction, particularly in areas where access to allografts is limited. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: A 3-cm longitudinal skin incision is placed 2 fingerbreadths (or 3 cm) proximal to the tip of the lateral malleolus, and 3 mm posterior to the fibula. The PL and peroneus brevis tendons are identified and isolated, followed by a tenodesis at the distal limit of the incision. The PL is whipstitched proximal to the tenodesis site, and then incised between the tenodesis and whipstitched portion. A closed tendon stripper is inserted and advanced proximally until the PL graft is released. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: PL autograft harvest has been shown to generate thicker and longer grafts relative to the semitendinosus, with demonstrated efficacy in terms of both biomechanical and clinical outcomes. Current literature points largely to a good safety profile, although there is still conflicting evidence in terms of foot and ankle morbidity and no mid- to long-term follow-up data available.

The advantages of percutaneous LCL reconstruction include small incisions, minimal soft tissue disruption, less postoperative pain, and speedy rehabilitation and recovery. The aim of this study was to report the functional outcome of percutaneous LCL reconstruction and overall patient satisfaction in Africans. METHODS: This prospective and interventional study involving 51 patients with chronic LCL rupture who had percutaneous LCL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft was conducted between January 2021 and December 2022 in National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dala-Kano, Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were patients between the ages of 18 and 45 years with chronic isolated LCL and not more than 1 injury of knee ligament. Exclusion criteria were active infection, and multi-ligament knee injury requiring 2-staged surgery. The knee functions were assessed preoperatively, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using the Lysholm scoring system. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of the treatment was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Relevant information was recorded into Microsoft Excel sheet and data was analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 for windows. The paired samples t-test was used to compare the clinical outcomes as continuous variables. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was (30.10 ± 5.90) years. The median time from injury to surgery was 7 months (ranging from 3 to 28 months). The mean follow-up period was (14.07 ± 3.13) months. The mean preoperative and 1-year postoperative Lysholm scores were 44.33 ± 12.97 and 97.96 ± 1.23, respectively.

However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1β stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. RESULTS: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study illustrated that the administered Plt-exos could alleviate knee OA by attenuating cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, possibly serving as a novel promising treatment for OA in the future.",2023-09,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,2975-2985,,11,51,,Am J Sports Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 37551685,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37551685,,"Aged; Animals; Blood Platelets; cartilage; Cartilage Diseases; Cartilage, Articular; Chondrocytes; exosomes; Exosomes; Humans; Mice; osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis, Knee; platelet; X-Ray Microtomography",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19±8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing.",2023-08,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,42-49,,Suppl3,62,,Acta Clin Croat,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 40337648 PMCID: PMC12054457,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\XWKVJQLT\Josipović et al.

But there are potential risks and complications associated with its use as a graft. This retrospective study aimed to examine the complications and donor site morbidity following PLT harvesting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on an institutional digital patient database, and all patients who underwent ligament reconstruction using PLT autograft were identified. Intraoperative, early, and late complications were reviewed using digital patient notes and patients underwent a complete physical examination during their final follow-up. Ankle function was assessed using the AOFAS score, and manual ankle muscle testing was performed on both sides. Sural nerve iatrogenic injury was evaluated with a dermatomal light touch examination. Cosmetic satisfaction due to incision scar and footwear complaints were also assessed. RESULTS: 82 patients (74 male, eight female) with a mean age of 31.9 ± 10.4 years (range, 16-66) were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up time was 46.6 ± 30.3 months (range, 6-109). The mean AOFAS score for the donor side was 98.7 ± 3.3 (range, 87-100), and the contralateral side score was 100, with manual muscle testing graded as 5 in all movements and similar to the contralateral side. Fifteen patients (18.3%) had hypoesthesia over the dorsolateral aspect of the foot distal to the incision scar, two patients (2.4%) had hyperalgesia over the distal incision scar, and one patient (1.2%) had mild ankle instability. There were two cases (2.4%) of compartment syndrome, both of which were treated with fasciotomy and had complete regression of symptoms after 5 days. One patient (1.2%) had a transient peroneal nerve injury and foot drop that resolved in the sixth month. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest that harvesting the PLT is associated with a high rate of complications and donor site morbidity. The most common complication was hypoesthesia around the lateral side of the foot, although the ankle functions were not affected significantly. Two cases of compartment syndrome and one transient peroneal nerve injury were observed. Care should be taken while harvesting PLT autograft, and it should be kept in mind that peroneal nerve injury might occur.

There is very little literature on it. Hence, our study aims to compare the functional outcomes, knee stability, donor site morbidity, and assessment of thigh muscle wasting in patients with ACL injury managed by arthroscopic single bundle reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendons (HT), respectively. Methods All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL deficiency were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups. Results One hundred and ninety-four patients (hamstring n = 96, peroneus n = 98) met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences between the preoperative, six-month postoperative, and one-year postoperative scores between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (p=0.356) and Lysholm knee score (p=0.289). The mean for the AOFAS was 99.05 ± 3.56 and 99.80 ± 0.70 in the PLT and HT groups, respectively, showing no statistical difference, with a significant improvement in thigh muscle wasting among the PLT group at final follow-up (p < 0.001). Conclusion We observed similar knee stability and functional outcomes and no obvious donor site morbidity among both groups. These patients also had better responses to physiotherapy in recovering from their thigh muscle wasting. So, we can recommend that a PL graft can be a safe, viable, and effective option for usual arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.",2023-04,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,e37273,,4,15,,Cureus,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 37168157 PMCID: PMC10164842,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\H6YI9L29\Agarwal et al.

However, clinical data on graft size are limited. PURPOSE: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 ± 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 ± 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 ± 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 ± 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). CONCLUSION: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT.",2023-06,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,1743-1751,,7,51,,Am J Sports Med,Peroneus Longus Split Versus Semitendinosus Tendon Autograft Size,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 37092720,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37092720,,"ACL; anthropometrics; Autografts; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; knee ligaments; Ligaments, Articular; peroneus longus; semitendinosus; Tendons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three- and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. RESULTS: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. CONCLUSION: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance.",2023-03,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,133-141,,1,17,,Malays Orthop J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 37064638 PMCID: PMC10103913,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\XHZ7XVBI\Sahoo and Sahu (2023).pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37064638,,anterior cruciate ligament; centre of pressure; force plate; peroneus longus tendon; postural control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 cm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5 mm. RESULTS: CSA at 1 cm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6 + 0.2 × [sonographic CSA of PLT at 1 cm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6 + 0.5 × Calf length. CONCLUSION: The diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.

The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P < .001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy.

Bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring autografts have been considered the gold standard for decades. Despite the good clinical outcomes, donor-site morbidity is a concern for both of these grafts2. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has also been considered as a potential graft for many orthopaedic reconstructive procedures3. The biomechanical properties and thickness of such a graft permit its use for ACL reconstruction3,4. The tensile strength of a peroneus longus tendon autograft is the same as that of a hamstring autograft and greater than that of a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and a quadriceps tendon graft3,5. We aimed to describe the steps to harvest the peroneus longus tendon autograft during single-bundle ACL reconstruction. DESCRIPTION: Identification of anatomical landmarks is performed, including the distal aspect of the fibula and the posterior border of the fibula, 2 cm above the tip of the bone. A longitudinal incision is made along the posterior border of the fibular bone, from 2cm above the tip of the fibula. Care is taken to identify the tendon sheath that covers the longus and brevis approximately 2 cm above the superior extensor retinaculum, and the peroneus longus is stitched to the peroneus brevis. The proximal aspect of the peroneus longus tendon is whipstitched, after which the peroneus longus tendon and surrounding soft tissues are incised. The peroneus longus tendon is then released with use of a closed stripper, and the graft is prepared. ALTERNATIVES: Alternative nonoperative treatment options include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rest, and limitation of sporting activities. Alternative surgical treatment options include arthroscopic debridement, ACL repair or reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring-tendon autograft, and ACL reconstruction with allograft. RATIONALE: Recent studies have shown that ACL reconstruction with use of a peroneus longus tendon autograft is safe and effective, with less donor-site morbidity compared with other tendon autografts4,6,7. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: The peroneus longus graft has been accepted for ligament reconstruction because of its strength, safety, and less donor-site morbidity7. The peroneus longus graft allows surgeons to harvest the autograft via a relatively small incision, resulting in fewer donor-site complications4. According to Rhatomy et al., the use of a peroneus longus graft provides good functional outcomes that are comparable with those of a hamstring autograft, but it has a larger graft diameter and its harvest results in less thigh hypotrophy8. Additionally, a case series of 10 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with use of a peroneus longus autograft showed satisfactory Lysholm scores and low disability according to the Foot and Ankle Disability Index9. IMPORTANT TIPS: Examination under anesthesia and arthroscopic confirmation of the ACL tear are recommended prior to harvesting the peroneus longus tendon.Take care to identify the anatomical landmarks of the peroneus longus and brevis.Tenodesis of the peroneus longus to the brevis is performed first, followed by whipstitching of the peroneus longus proximal to the site of the tenodesis.Once the peroneus longus tendon is passed through the closed stripper, gently maintain traction on the sutures while pushing the stripper proximally until the tendon is freed.Care should be taken not to damage the superior peroneal retinaculum, which provides the primary restraint to tendon subluxation.Identification of the peroneus longus and brevis is important. The peroneus longus tendon is free of muscle attachment and more rounded in shape, while the peroneus brevis contains muscle fibers.

Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. RESULTS: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (β = 15.45 mm2; Šidák adjusted P < .0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (β = -17.20 N per year; adjusted P = .0253), and increased CSA (β = 1.92 mm2 per inch; adjusted P < .0001) and maximum load (β = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P < .0001) with each inch of increased height. CONCLUSION: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely. The findings indicate that age negatively affected only the Achilles tendon (maximum load) and challenge the exclusion of donors aged >65 years across all tendon grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings support including a broader range of tendons for use as allografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and reviewing the current exclusion criterion of donors aged >65 years.",2023-03,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,768-778,,3,51,,Am J Sports Med,Challenging the Perceptions of Human Tendon Allografts,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 36594505,,; C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\6MXYQFNT\Ashton et al.

METHODS: Thirty patients with complete ACL tears were operated on. In all these patients, the thickness or length of the hamstring graft taken was found to be inadequate (less than 8 mm and 7.5 cm, respectively). So, additionally, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) graft was harvested to reach an optimum size of the final graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six weeks, three months, and six months. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score at six months was used to assess ankle stability. RESULTS: The mean age in our study was 28.8 years with male predominance (73.33%). The mean operative time was 86.4 minutes. The mean hamstring graft thickness in our study was 6.5 mm, which improved to 9.12 mm after augmentation. The mean graft length after AHPLT augmentation was 9.38 cm. The mean IKDC score at six months was 87.35. At the end of six months, FADI scores were found within normal limits (range: 135-136) in all the patients. No complications were noted in any of the patients.

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24-31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P<0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. CONCLUSION: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20° flexion angle. A standardized 12-N·m varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. RESULTS: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 ± 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 ± 0.6 and 2.2 ± 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P = .387). CONCLUSION: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries.

Some studies have reported that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has sufficient length and strength. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that the PLT can be used as a novel appropriate material for PCL reconstruction therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we systematically analysed the clinical effect of the double-stranded PLT and the four-stranded hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the PCL and compared the effectiveness and safety of these two surgical approaches in the reconstruction of PCL injury. A total of 48 patients with complete rupture of the PCL were divided into Group A (reconstructed with the double-stranded PLT, 25 cases) and Group B (reconstructed with the four-stranded hamstring tendon, 23 cases). RESULTS: The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The intraoperative time for tendon extraction was significantly shorter in Group A than Group B. Twenty-four months after operation, patients in the two groups showed the alleviated tibial posterior displacement and the increased IKDC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score. Nevertheless, these scores showed no significant differences between the two groups. Additionally, compared with the therapy using the four-stranded hamstring tendon, therapy using the double-stranded PLT is simpler and safer. DISCUSSION: Both surgical methods are effective in the treatment of PCL injury.

The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. PURPOSE: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-N·m force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P = .863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ± 0.83-cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL-posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ± 1.02-cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ± 1.35-cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P = .154). CONCLUSION: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height.

Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. RESEARCH QUESTION: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (n = 27) and ligament dominance (n = 27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (P < 0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance.",2022-03,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,225-229,,,93,,Gait Posture,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 35183840,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\78WBRJK5\Saki et al.

Traumatic posterior root of medial meniscus (PRMM) tears are commonly found in high-grade injuries involving anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears along with MCL tears. Diagnosis of these injuries can be made by a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but they can be missed at times due to severe soft-tissue swelling in the acute phase. CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old gentleman presented with injury to the front of his left knee 5 days back. On examination, he had a Grade 3 effusion with valgus stress test and posterior drawer test being positive and medial joint line tenderness was present. A firm localized swelling was palpable on the medial joint line. MRI scan revealed a mid-substance PCL tear, ACL sprain, PRMM tear, and tibial side rupture of superficial MCL with proximally migrated wavy MCL fibers lying below the medial meniscus confirmed on arthroscopy. Medial meniscus root repair by pull through technique and PCL reconstruction with a 3-strand peroneus longus graft followed by open MCL repair with augmentation using a semitendinosus graft was performed. Postoperatively, the knee was kept in a straight knee brace for 4 weeks, followed by a hinged knee brace and appropriate physiotherapy were started. At 2 years follow-up, the patient had attained full range of knee motion with good quadriceps strength, tibial step off maintained, and negative posterior drawer test and valgus stress test. Displacement of torn MCL into the medial knee compartment is an extremely rare injury. Proximal or distal avulsion of MCL with intra-articular incarceration has been reported in isolation or associated with ACL tear. Such an injury triad as reported here has not been reported in the literature to the best of our review. CONCLUSION: In our case, we report a very unusual injury triad of PCL tear, PRMM tear, and distal MCL tear with intra-articular entrapment below the medial meniscus operated by a single-stage surgery with excellent outcomes.",2021-08,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,28-32,,8,11,,J Orthop Case Rep,Tibial Avulsion with Intra-Articular Entrapment of Medial Collateral Ligament with Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tear with Posterior Root Medial Meniscus Tear,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 35004370 PMCID: PMC8686511,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35004370,,intra-articular entrapment; Medial collateral ligament tear; posterior cruciate ligament tear; posterior root medial meniscus tear; unusual triad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neglected injuries have a direct impact on the prognosis due to residual instability, chronic pain, deformities, and failure to repair other structures. Several techniques are used to reconstruct the posterolateral corner, often with autologous ischiotibial grafts or homologous grafts. An option little used for knee ligament reconstructions is the peroneus longus tendon graft. Although reported as a good alternative for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, we found no case using a peroneus longus tendon graft for posterolateral corner reconstruction. Here, we describe the case of a patient who underwent a non-anatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral corner using a peroneus longus tendon graft. The patient underwent surgical procedures for ligament reconstruction and correction of the deformity caused by a failed graft, but his knee remained unstable. During the preoperative planning, it was decided to reconstruct the posterolateral corner with an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft. Studies have shown that the peroneus longus tendon graft does not increase ankle morbidity, and that its length and diameter favor ligament reconstruction. Thus, the present article highlights the importance of the proper diagnosis of ligament injuries in the acute phase, and describes a new technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction that must be included in the surgeon's body of knowledge, increasing the amount of technical options.",2023-12,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,e968-e972,,6,58,,Rev Bras Ortop (Sao Paulo),,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 38077768 PMCID: PMC10708983,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\5PDP4YHL\Oliveira et al.

This study also investigated whether the occurrence of patellar ligament thickening (PLT), which is commonly observed 2 months postoperatively after TPLO, is associated with misplacement of the osteotomy. A total of 120 dogs weighing more than 20 kg, 40 of which were control animals, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Stifles were radiographically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively on the side with CCLR and on the healthy contralateral side and compared with clinically normal stifles. PLT was reassessed after 2 months. RESULTS: Significant decreases in median patellar height ratio were found after both procedures (TPLO 0.24 (0.05-0.8); CCWO 0.22 (0.05-0.4)). The postoperative craniocaudal patellar position and the median AMA angle differed significantly among the groups (P = 0.000) (TPLO 87.5% caudal to the AA and 3.12° (0.76-6.98°); CCWO 100% cranial to the AA and 0° (- 1.34-0.65°); control group 5% caudal to the AA and 0.99° (0-3.39°)). At 8 weeks, PLT grade differed significantly in the two operated groups (P = 0.000) (TPLO 40% 0-2, 20% 2-4, 40% > 4; CCWO 98.8% 0). CONCLUSIONS: TPLO and AMA-based CCWO are associated with significant decreases in patellar height; however, the PLT results 2 months postoperatively differed between the two groups; the decrease in patellar height and PLT were independent of osteotomy position in the TPLO group. Compared to TPLO, CCWO results in reduced postoperative AMA angles and craniocaudal patellar positions that more closely resemble those of unaffected dogs, suggesting that the CCWO procedure allows us to better correct the caudal bowing of the proximal tibia that is often associated with deficient stifles in large dogs with TPA > 30°.",12/3/2021,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,368,,1,17,,BMC Vet Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 34861875 PMCID: PMC8641203,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\M5VBSC3D\Guénégo et al.

There is no published literature regarding the anthropometric predictors for the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft obtained in ACL reconstruction through the inframalleolar approach. METHODS: Fifty-two patients were finally evaluated for anthropometric parameters to predict quadrupled PLT graft diameter in ACL reconstruction using the inframalleolar technique. Intraoperative quadrupled PLT graft diameter was correlated to the patient's anthropometric data such as age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. We used regression analysis in a stepwise manner to ascertain anthropometric indices associated with the graft diameter. RESULTS: This study included 46 males and six females. Mean age was 28.2 ± 7.4 years, mean height was 172.7 ± 2.8 cm, mean weight was 75.6 ± 3.4 kg, mean BMI was 25.3 ± 0.9 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 9.2 ± 3.9 months, and mean graft diameter was 9.3 ± 0.4 mm. Positive correlation with graft diameter was found only with height (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and weight (r = 0.4, P < 0.01). On analysing through linear regression, height and weight had significant association with graft diameter, and we formulated the following prediction equation: PLT graft diameter (mm) = 0.083 × height (cm) + 0.011 × weight (kg) -5.854.

We assessed the ability of healthy athletes to reweight somaesthetic signals during postural perturbations on different surfaces. Thirty-five young (16 ± 1 years), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10 s), VIBRATION (20 s) and POST (20 s) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a ""rigid"" strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a ""plastic"" strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (p < 0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (p < 0.05).

Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. METHODS: This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. RESULTS: Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22-31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5-8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p =  < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients.

The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery.

Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21 kGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21 kGy) and storage times (5 and 6 months) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading.

Therefore, an alternative autograft option with adequate strength and less donor site morbidity will be very valuable. Peroneus longus tendon has been found to be a promising option. INDICATION: Primary ACL reconstruction. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: Peroneus longus tendon graft is harvested with a longitudinal skin incision at 2 to 3 cm (2 finger-breadths) above and 1 cm (1 finger-breadth) behind the lateral malleolus, followed by superficial fascia incision in line with skin incision. The peroneus longus and peroneus brevis tendons were then identified. The tendon division location was marked at 2 to 3 cm above the level of the lateral malleolus. After that, an end-to-side suture was performed between the distal part of the peroneus longus tendon and peroneus brevis tendon. The peroneus longus tendon was stripped proximally with a tendon stripper to at least 5 cm from the fibular head to prevent peroneal nerve injury. Graft preparation was performed with a standard procedure to obtain the suitable graft size. In routine arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, peroneus longus tendon graft fixation can be performed with a cortical suspension device, bioabsorbable screws, or a combined technique. RESULTS: Recent studies showed that peroneus longus autograft had a comparable outcome with hamstring tendon autograft in primary ACL reconstruction at a 1-year follow-up. The use of peroneus longus tendon autograft resulted in larger graft diameter and less thigh hypotrophy. The mean (±SD) for the AOFAS-Hindfoot Score in the peroneus longus group was 97.3 ± 4.2, while the mean FADI score was 98 ± 3.4, both of which were considered excellent results. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of peroneus longus autograft in primary ACL reconstruction is a safe procedure with an excellent outcome. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be recommended as an alternative graft in single-bundle ACL reconstruction.

Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. PURPOSE: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30° of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. RESULTS: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 ± 0.62 vs 7.0 ± 2.18 mm, respectively; P < .001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 ± 8.27, 50.9 ± 8.50, and 1.8 ± 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 ± 2.61, 95.2 ± 2.64, and 6.8 ± 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P < .001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. The choice of graft is principal in providing optimal knee stability after surgery. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is an autograft modality that offers unique benefits for ACL reconstruction cases. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a case of ACL reconstruction surgery using PLT graft in a patient with a confirmed ACL rupture. Assessment of post-surgical pain, knee stability, and ankle function were performed to determine functional outcome and donor site morbidity. The follow-up results revealed favorable recovery and improvement in all objective parameters. DISCUSSION: Post-operative biomechanical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score.

However, all these grafts are associated with many complications. Lately, peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has shown promising results in this field, although there is still a dearth of data on its use. We, therefore, aimed at carrying out a study to evaluate the functional outcome and knee stability results of ACL reconstruction using PLT graft. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a completely torn ACL were included in the study. The PLT was harvested, and graft length, thickness, and harvesting time were noted intraoperatively. Knee stability and functional scores were evaluated clinically and using Lachman test (primarily) and KT-2000 arthrometer and subjectively with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 6, 12, and 24 months (secondary outcome) postoperatively. Ankle scores were also recorded by making use of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS)-Hindfoot Scale. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. The graft harvest time was 7.4 min (5-9 min). The mean thickness of the graft on doubling was 7.9 mm (7-9 mm). Ninety-six percent of the patients were satisfied with their results of the knee surgery, and 95% of the patients had no complaints of ankle joint. The mean IKDC score postoperatively was 78.16 ± 6.23, and the mean AOFAS score was 98.4 ± 4.1. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using PLT graft yields a good functional score (IKDC, KT-2000 arthrometer) even at 2-year follow-up.

METHODS: A clinical data of 30 patients with PCL injury, who were admitted between December 2015 and September 2018 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon and TightRope technique. Among them, 19 were male and 11 were female, aged 17-48 years (mean, 28.2 years). The PCL injury was caused by traffic accident in 8 cases, sport in 14 cases, falling and bruising by a heavy objective in 5 cases, and other injuries in 3 cases. The interval between injury and operation was 10-90 days (mean, 39.3 days). The PCL injury was rated as grade Ⅱ in 6 cases and grade Ⅲ in 24 cases. The posterior drawer test was positive in 26 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 24 cases. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 61.37±8.49, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was near normal in 2 cases, abnormal in 8 cases, and significantly abnormal in 20 cases. The modified Lysholm knee score was 62.20±5.67. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (101.83±8.15) °. RESULTS: The operative time ranged from 70 to 110 minutes (mean, 79.7 minutes). All incisions healed by first intetion. All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 19.0 months). There were 3 cases of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity after operation, and 1 case of approximately 10° limitation of knee extension. At last follow-up, the posterior drawer test was positive in 2 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 1 case, with significant differences compared with the preoperative period ( χ 2=38.571, P=0.000; χ 2=36.274, P=0.000). The IKDC score was 84.67±3.67, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was normal in 16 cases, nearly normal in 10 cases, abnormal in 3 cases, and significantly abnormal in 1 case; the modified Lysholm knee score was 90.37±4.49; all of the above indexes were significantly better than preoperative ones, and the differences were significant ( t=-12.387, P=0.000; Z=-2.810, P=0.005; t=-22.865, P=0.000). Knee ROM was (88.33±9.86)° at 1 month after operation and reached (113.33±13.48)° at last follow-up, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ± 6.73, and 29.6 ± 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision.

A human knee model study,The Knee,,1873-5800,10.1016/j.knee.2021.02.026,,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. METHODS: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. RESULTS: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. CONCLUSION: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered.",2021-03,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,381-389,,,29,,Knee,Does the anterolateral ligament protect the anterior cruciate ligament in the most common injury mechanisms?,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 33711673,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\WYTHUPCK\Blanke et al.

METHODS: All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6 weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48 ± 9.9 years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2%) or chondral (40.7%) injuries. At the 2 years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p = 0.0001) IKDC score (p = 0.0001), Lysholm score (p = 0.0001), and range of motion (p = 0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years' follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. CONCLUSION: Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes.

HYPOTHESIS: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. RESULTS: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 ± 0.40 vs 2.09 ± 0.54 N, respectively; P = .006) (stiffness: 3.43 ± 0.56 vs 1.75 ± 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P < .001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 ± 1.13 vs 7.14 ± 0.94 N, respectively; P = .008) (stiffness: 4.45 ± 0.75 vs 3.36 ± 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P = .008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 ± 4.98 vs 5.16 ± 3.98, respectively; P < .001) (EA: 19.66 ± 7.19 vs 10.85 ± 2.16, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 ± 5.04 vs 17.11 ± 7.31, respectively; P = .010) (MT: 21.15 ± 2.58 vs 15.55 ± 4.48, respectively; P = .041) (EA: 20.75 ± 3.87 vs 10.64 ± 3.94, respectively; P = .003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 ± 8.05 vs 15.21 ± 7.60, respectively; P = .007) (EA: 25.19 ± 6.38 vs 13.94 ± 7.10, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 ± 4.45 vs 47.80 ± 6.16, respectively; P < .001) (MT: 33.15 ± 3.88 vs 13.76 ± 4.07, respectively; P < .001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 ± 17.49 vs 182.97 ± 14.35 μm, respectively; P < .001), 8 weeks (58.86 ± 10.99 vs 90.15 ± 11.53 μm, respectively; P = .002), and 12 weeks (42.70 ± 7.96 vs 67.29 ± 6.55 μm, respectively; P = .001) than in the HB group. CONCLUSION: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction may result in improved biomechanical properties and tendon-bone incorporation compared with a hybrid graft.

METHODS: Eighty healthy New Zealand white rabbits were harvested to prepare ACL injury models and randomly divided into two groups ( n=40). The ACL was reconstructed with vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft in group A and peroneus longus tendon graft without blood supply in group B. The survival of animals and the healing of incision were observed after operation; the grafts were taken for gross and histological observations at 4, 8, and 16 weeks; the biomechanical test of the grafts was carried out to record the maximum tensile strength and incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks. RESULTS: All animals survived until the experiment completed. General observation showed that the tunnel was combined with grafts, the vascular infiltration was abundant, and no obvious boundary between the tunnel and grafts existed at 16 weeks in group A; there was still an obvious boundary between the tunnel and graft in group B. Histological observation showed that the collagen fibers between tendon and bone in group A increased gradually, the dense fiber connection was formed, and the ""tidal-line"" like structure similar to the normal ACL insertion was formed at 16 weeks; but the""tidal-line"" like structure was not obvious in group B. Biomechanical test showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks between group A and group B ( P=0.680; P=0.590), but the maximum tensile strength at 8 and 16 weeks were higher in group A than in group B ( t=18.503, P=0.001; t=25.391, P=0.001).

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 35 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy between October 2017 and October 2018. There were 19 males and 16 females with an average age of 43.4 years (range, 18-60 years), with 20 cases of left knee and 15 cases of right knee. The causes of injury included traffic accident in 14 cases, falling injury in 13 cases, and sports injury in 8 cases. The time from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean, 4.7 days). The patients suffered from swelling, pain, and limited mobility of knee joint before operation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were positive before operation, whereas MRI was taken to confirm the ACL rupture. After operation, the patients were followed up every 3 months until the knee joint's function returned to normal. MRI and X-ray films were used to observe the tendon-bone healing as well as the position of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were conducted to observe the improvement of knee joint mobility. The functional improvements were evaluated by the International Knee Documents Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee injury and osteoarthritis (KOOS) score. RESULTS: All the 35 patients were followed up 12-18 months, with an average of 14.2 months. The incisions healed by first intention, and no complications such as infection, joint stiffness, and rerupture occurred. Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test turned to be negative of all patients. MRI showed that the ACL was continuous, and the tendon-bone in the distal femur tunnel and proximal tibia tunnel recovered well after operation. X-ray films showed that the positions of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail were stable. The IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with those before operation, and the scores were further improved with time after operation ( P<0.05).

This study aimed to quantify the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. METHODS: Patients who suffered isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent isolated single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft. Functional score (IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score) were assessed at pre-operative and 2-years after surgery. Graft diameter was measured intraoperative. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurement and ankle scoring using AOFAS and FADI. We also measured serial hop test. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Peroneus longus graft diameter was 8.38 ± 0.68 mm.

The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. METHOD: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. RESULT: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length.

However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 ± 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .55), with means of 65.87 ± 7.63 N and 66.96 ± 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .68), with means of 150.64 ± 11.67 N and 152.10 ± 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 ± 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 ± 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results.

KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: The method of ACL reconstruction via arthroscopic GraftLink technique with PLT and MCL repair via suture anchor fixation has the advantages of less knee injury and faster recovery, and there is no significant impact on ankle function after tendon removal.",6/15/2019,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,685-688,,6,33,,Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,,,,,,,,chi,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 31197994 PMCID: PMC8355763,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197994,,Adult; anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Arthroscopy; autologous tendon; Collateral Ligaments; Female; GraftLink technique; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; medial collateral ligament; Middle Aged; suture anchor; Suture Anchors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. METHODS: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000 cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. FINDINGS: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x < 40 yo, 40 yo ≤ x < 60 yo, 60 yo < x). INTERPRETATION: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness.",2019-07,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,90-95,,,67,,Clin Biomech (Bristol),,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 31082636,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\AY2UZNCB\Wong et al.

Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. METHODS: Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE. White blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelet count (PLT), IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, anti-cardiolipin (Acl), ANA, AnuA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, β2-GPI, urinalysis, and 24 h urine protein were measured by standard laboratory techniques. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. RESULTS: The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P = 0.0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P = 0.017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.",2019,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,7430780,,,2019,,J Immunol Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 31049359 PMCID: PMC6462327,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\3CLV9S3Z\Sun et al.

Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 ± 0.7 mm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 ± 0.8 mm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 ± 4.2 and for the FADI 98 ± 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.

METHODS: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. RESULTS: Ultimate load to failure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 ± 49.6 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87 N) versus 719.6 ± 69.6 N (95% CI, 671.38-767.82 N; P = .044). Less graft elongation at failure was observed in the supplemented group (3.1 ± 1.5 mm; 95% CI, 2.07-4.17 mm) versus the control group (21.0 ± 21.2 mm; 95% CI, 6.31-35.69 mm; P = .052). The number of grafts undergoing a 5-mm or greater change in length at failure was 1 of 8 in the supplemented group versus 5 of 8 in the control group (P = .038).

METHODS: The levels of serum s-Eng were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 139 patients with APS, 44 patients with SLE but no APS, 37 patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), 23 patients with Bechet's disease (BD), 22 patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and 22 persistent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) positive individuals without SLE or APS (simply aCL positive group) and 87 health controls (HC) without any auto-immune diseases. These APS patients included 64 primary APS patients and 75 APS patients secondary to SLE.The correlation between the clinical data, laboratory parameters, and serum s-Eng levels were analyzed.Independent samples t test, paired t test, Chi-square Test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's χ2 test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: (1) The serum levels of s-Eng were significantly higher in the patients with APS whether primary or secondary to SLE than in the health controls and simply aCL positive group and the patients with other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, pSS, BD and SSc (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum s-Eng levels between simply aCL positive group and health controls [(5.17±2.00) mg/L vs. (5.04±1.11) mg/L, P>0.05]. (2) The best cut-off value for the diagnosis of APS was no less than 8.37 mg/L as mean ± 3SD value, with the sensitivity at 0.772 and the specificity at 0.928. The Youden index was 0.700. These results indicated good validity of s-Eng as a diagnostic marker for APS. (3) The proportions of artery thrombosis and pathological pregnancy were higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than that in s-Eng-negative group (46/81 vs. 19/58, 29/65 vs. 10/44, respectively, all P<0.05).

Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. METHOD: Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5-1 mm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70-220 N for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young's modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer's solution at 37 °C and the CSA recorded over 12 h. Twelve compressed and 12 control quadrupled grafts were mounted in porcine femurs, placed in Ringer's solution for 12 h at 37 °C and graft displacement at the bone tunnel aperture recorded under cyclic loading. RESULTS: Mean decreases in CSA of 31% under a stress of 471 kPa and 21% under a stress of 447 kPa were observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12 h compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3 mm for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement.",2018-08,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,2430-2437,,8,26,,Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,ACL graft compression,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 29623378,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\N7JXDV8H\Lord et al.

However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 ± 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging.

At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 ± 7.1 vs. 89.3. ± 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 ± 0.57 vs. 1.85 ± 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 ± 0.36 vs. 0.10 ± 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 ± 1.40 vs. 99.5 ± 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up. An AHPLT autograft may be a good alternative for all-inside ACL reconstruction with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.",2018-11,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,1022-1030,,10,31,,J Knee Surg,All-Inside Single-Bundle Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with the Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Compared to the Semitendinosus Tendon,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 29421837,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\77747PY5\Bi et al.

The purpose of this study was to compare revision rate and patient-reported outcomes following primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft versus a preoperatively planned hybrid autograft-allograft. At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. From this collection of patients, a matched-pair comparison was made between groups, with patients matched by gender, age at the time of surgery, and follow-up time. Revision rate at follow-up was 8.4 and 2.4% in the A and H groups, respectively (p = 0.073). A total of 148 surveys were completed (83 A, 65 H), from which 36 matched pairs were formed. Within the matched pairs, average age at surgery did not differ significantly between groups (A: 35.7 years, H: 36.0 years, p = 0.23). Time to follow-up was 4.3 and 3.7 years in the A and H groups, respectively. Patients with a hybrid graft had significantly higher KOOS Quality of Life subscores (A 69.6, H 79.2, p = 0.028), subjective IKDC scores (A 72.6, H 79.7, p = 0.031), and SANE scores (A 83.2, H 91.4, p = 0.015) at follow-up.

We addressed whether altered muscular activity is such a factor. METHODS: 16 participants with unilateral, non-reconstructed ACL rupture were scored for altered movement patterns according to Test for Substitution Patterns (TSP), which includes the single-leg squat (SLS). Surface electromyography (SEMG), was recorded in the lower extremities at initiation of weight-transfer from double-leg to single-leg stance (eyes closed), simulating the initiation of an SLS. Normalised SEMG amplitudes 200-300 ms after weight-transfer initiation were compared between injured and non-injured sides, and correlated to the TSP scores for the SLS. Peak absolute SEMG amplitudes during 5 TSP test movements were also compared between sides. RESULTS: At weight-transfer initiation, muscle activity was lower in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. Low muscle activity correlated moderately to worse TSP scores for the SLS for the gluteus medius (rs=-0.56, p=0.03), and gastrocnemius muscles (rs=-0.56, p=0.02). Median peak absolute amplitude during TSP movements was lower in the quadriceps, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. CONCLUSIONS: The altered patterns of muscle activity at weight-transfer initiation, correlations between lower activity at movement initiation and altered movement patterns during SLS and the altered peak amplitudes during TSP movements together indicate alterations in sensorimotor control that may contribute to the observed altered movement patterns. Future studies will determine if exercises targeting muscle activity initiation should complement customary ACL injury rehabilitation.",2016,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,e000131,,1,2,,BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 28890799 PMCID: PMC5566258,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\Q3LPDK8D\Trulsson et al.

The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UTε). RESULTS: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UTϵ. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UTϵ was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. CONCLUSION: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UTϵ and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise.",2017-03,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,701-707,,3,45,,Am J Sports Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 28272925,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\HACB5WZ9\Palmer et al.

Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. PURPOSE: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. RESULTS: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0° in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35° anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35° anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40° proximally in the coronal plane and 20° to 40° anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40° proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20° proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0° in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CONCLUSION: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35° anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40° proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20° proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0° in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The risk of tunnel convergence with the ACL and PCL femoral tunnels can be reduced by adjusting the orientation of the FCL and PLT tunnels and the sMCL and POL tunnels, respectively.",2017-03,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,563-569,,3,45,,Am J Sports Med,Multiple Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnels,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27872126,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\RYIPT923\Moatshe et al.

METHODS: Seven pairs of peroneus longus (PL) and ten pairs of peroneus brevis (PB) tendons were procured from human cadavers. The diameter of each allograft was measured. The left side of each allograft was IR at 1.5-2.5 Mrad, whereas the right side was kept aseptic and NI. The allografts were thawed, kept wet with saline, and attached in a single-strand fashion to custom freeze grips using liquid nitrogen. A preload of 10 N was then applied and, after it had reached steady state, the allografts were pulled at 4 cm/sec. The parameters recorded were the displacement and force. RESULTS: The elongation at the peak load was 10.3±2.3 mm for the PB NI side and 13.5±3.3 mm for the PB IR side. The elongation at the peak load was 17.4±5.3 mm for the PL NI side and 16.3±2.0 mm for the PL IR side. For PL, the ultimate load was 2,091.6±148.7 N for NI and 2,122.8±380.0 N for IR. The ultimate load for the PB tendons was 1,485.7±209.3 N for NI and 1,318.4±296.9 N for the IR group. The ultimate stress calculations for PL were 90.3±11.3 MPa for NI and 94.8±21.0 MPa for IR. For the PB, the ultimate stress was 82.4±19.0 MPa for NI and 72.5±16.6 MPa for the IR group. The structural stiffness was 216.1±59.0 N/mm for the NI PL and 195.7±51.4 N/mm for the IR side. None of these measures were significantly different between the NI and IR groups. The structural stiffness was 232.1±45.7 N/mm for the NI PB and 161.9±74.0 N/mm for the IR side, and this was the only statistically significant difference found in this study (P=0.034). CONCLUSION: Our statistical comparisons found no significant differences in terms of elongation, ultimate load, or ultimate stress between IR and NI PB and PL tendons. Only the PB structural stiffness was affected by irradiation. Thus, sterilizing allografts at 1.5-2.5 Mrad of gamma irradiation does not cause major alterations in the tendons' biomechanical properties while still providing a suitable amount of sterilization for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",2016,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,123-127,,,7,,Open Access J Sports Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27695371 PMCID: PMC5033496,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\JX8Y9RAU\Aguila et al.

However, because this technique uses suture loops and cortical suspension buttons for graft fixation, it has mostly been limited to looped graft constructs (e.g., hamstring autograft, peroneus longus allograft). Quadriceps tendon autograft offers several advantages in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but, until recently, has not been compatible with suture-loop and cortical suspensory fixation.

Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T1ρ and T2 mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated. Noyes Score (NS) clinical grades of cartilage lesions were noted at both times and correlated with relaxation times. Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T1ρ times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T1ρ increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T1ρ and T2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

DESIGN: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1ρ and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1ρ or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1ρ or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. RESULTS: Higher baseline SSD T1ρ posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1ρ pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 24 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft and endobutton fixation. Results of ACL reconstruction were assessed via physical examination. Donor site morbidity of the foot and ankle after tendon-harvesting was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot-and-Ankle Society (AOFAS) for ankle-hindfoot score and Visual Analogue Score-Foot Ankle (VAS-FA). Isokinetic testing for the ankle was performed in 10 voluntary patients after surgery. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Regarding the latest follow-up, anterior drawer tests of ankle showed normal findings in 83.3%, and 1+ anterior laxity in 16.7% of all patients. Mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS scores were 100.0 ± 0.0 and 96.0 ± 9.6, respectively at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.06). Mean pre- and postoperative VAS-FA scores were 99.7 ± 1.1 and 95.4 ± 12.0, respectively at - 13-month follow-up (p = 0.09). At 7-month follow-up by isokinetic testing, peak torques of eversion and inversion were significantly lower on the harvested ankle compared with the contralateral ankle at both velocities (60 degrees/second and 120 degrees/second, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on overall findings in the present study, the authors could not recommend the peroneus longus tendon as the first option of donor graft for ACL reconstruction due to the several morbidities particularly in the first 12 months after the operation. However, the peroneus longus tendon may be the option after other graft harvestings for the ligament reconstruction, which needs several tendon grafts in a patient with multi-directional instability of the knee due to some specific situation such as a traumatic knee dislocation.",2015-06,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,555-560,,6,98,,J Med Assoc Thai,The Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with the Peroneus Longus Tendon,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 26219159,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26219159,,"Ankle; Ankle Joint; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Foot; Humans; Knee Dislocation; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations and 10° axial/30° coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. RESULTS: Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10° axial/30° coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20° axial/20° coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater.",2016-01,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,195-200,,1,24,,Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25288339,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\CEC4RE36\Gali et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this controlled clinical trial, 375 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction arthroscopically using hamstring tendons in the orthopedic clinics of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2010 and 2011 were selected. Fifteen patients were included because their hamstring tendon diameter was lower than 8 mm and peroneus longus was added. After 6 months, the patients were followed using ""Kistler force plate"" to detect 3D kinematics and kinetics of the ankles and spatiotemporal walking parameters. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between both operated and non-operated ankles in flexion/extension range of motion (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the moments of both ankles in sagittal and coronal planes (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference between the moments of both ankles in the transverse plane (P = 0.006).

The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL. One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus longus and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. METHOD: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg.

METHODS: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. RESULTS: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N).

TYPE OF STUDY: A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. METHODS: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. RESULTS: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm2, 48 mm2, and 37 mm2, respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/mm) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. CONCLUSIONS: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources. The biomechanical properties observed for the TA, TP, and PL were noted in specimens despite an average age of 78.3 years.",2003-12,10/12/2025 8:42,10/12/2025 8:42,,1091-1096,,10,19,,Arthroscopy,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 14673451,,C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\E6ILD7VZ\Pearsall et al.

By 12 months after surgery, the anterior cruciate ligament allografts consisted predominantly of small-diameter collagen fibrils (30 to 80 nm), which resulted in a unimodal pattern in the collagen fibril profile. The number of large-diameter fibrils (90 to 140 nm) within the allogenic tendon grafts had decreased. This predominance of small-diameter collagen fibrils persisted in almost all specimens older than 12 months.

Patients and methods: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ± 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ± 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ± 3.9 (range = 85–100). Conclusion: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

Despite its clinical significance, morphometric data comparing right and left limbs and sex-based variations remain limited. This study aims to evaluate the morphometry of the Peroneus longus muscle and tendon in cadavers and its relationship with anthropometric parameters. Methods: A total of 38 independent human cadaveric lower limbs (22 Male, 16 Female; 18 Right, 20 left) were dissected. Measurements recorded included length of lower limb, length of thigh, length of leg, total muscle length, tendon length, and tendon width. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Comparisons were made between sexes and sides using independent sample t-tests. Correlations with anthropometric measures were assessed using Pearson’s correlation and linear regression where the regression models were adjusted for gender and side. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The mean length of the Peroneus longus muscle was 36.44 ± 2.66 cm, tendon length was 9.83 ± 2.48 cm, and tendon width was 6.19 ± 0.87 mm. Male cadavers demonstrated significantly greater tendon width compared to female cadavers (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found between right and left limbs for most parameters, although minor asymmetry was observed in tendon length. The Peroneus longus muscle was significantly longer in males than females (p < 0.05). No significant side-to-side differences were observed. Multivariable regression analyses were performed with adjustment for sex and side. Peroneus longus muscle length showed a strong positive relationship with leg length (β = 0.670, 95% CI: 0.341–0.998, p < 0.001) and thigh length (β = 0.382, 95% CI: 0.054–0.710, p = 0.024) when examined separately. In the mutually adjusted model, leg length remained the only significant predictor of Peroneus Longus muscle length (β = 0.563, 95% CI: 0.138–0.988, p = 0.011).For tendon outcomes, thigh length was positively associated with Peroneus Longus tendon thickness, both in univariable analysis (β = 0.133, 95% CI: 0.017–0.248, p = 0.026) and in the multivariable model. Conclusion: This study provides baseline morphometric data for the Peroneus longus muscle and its tendon, highlighting sexual dimorphism and anthropometric predictors of its morphometry, reinforcing its reliability as a tendon graft. Leg length predicts muscle length, while thigh length predicts tendon thickness, providing clinically useful preoperative markers.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,147-154,,10,14,,Int. J.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate ankle performance following PLT harvest for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed by searching five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Inclusion criteria included: ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft, ≥6-month follow-up, and validated ankle outcomes (American Orthopaedic Foot And Ankle Society [AOFAS]/Foot and Ankle Disability Index [FADI] scores). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models using R software (version 4.4.3). Heterogeneity was assessed via I² statistics, and risk of bias was evaluated using JBI checklists. RESULTS: Twenty articles (1024 patients) were identified, comprising eleven prospective cohort studies and nine randomised clinical trials (RCT), based on title, abstract, and quality assessments. Meta-analysis demonstrated excellent postoperative ankle function, with pooled AOFAS scores of 96.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.6-99.3) at 6 months, 96.1 (93.9-98.2) at 12 months, and 97.2 (93.9-100.6) at 24 months. FADI scores similarly improved to 97.4 (96.0-98.9) by 6 months and 99.4 (98.7-100.1) at 24 months. Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age and AOFAS outcomes (β = -0.23, p = 0.36). Minor complications (e.g., transient hypaesthesia) occurred in 13%-23% of patients but resolved within months. No studies reported major nerve injuries or ankle instability. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields minimal donor-site morbidity, with consistently high AOFAS/FADI scores across all age groups. These findings support the safety of PLT autografts, though heterogeneity is evident, and the predominance of male participants and the regional focus of studies, mainly Asian populations, may affect generalisability.Level II.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,"(Soleymanha M.; Soleymani Nejad A.)

Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon. Purpose: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Study Design: Case series, Level of evidence 4. Methods: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023. The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded. Results: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively). Conclusion: The peroneus longus tendon can be safely used as an alternative autograft in ACLR without causing donor site morbidity.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendon (HT) autografts for primary ACLR. Hypothesis: There would be no significant difference in patient outcomes between PLT and HT autografts in ACLR. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a thorough literature search was conducted on February 10, 2024, across the PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus databases. The aim was to identify comparative studies investigating the effectiveness of PLT and HT autografts for primary ACLR. The initial literature search retrieved 96 studies. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Data analysis was performed using RevMan Version 5.4.1. Functional scores, graft characteristics, donor site morbidity, and failure rates were compared. Results: Ten studies involving 949 patients were included. Both the PLT and HT groups showed comparable functional outcomes, knee stability, and graft failure rates. PLT autografts demonstrated a larger mean graft diameter (8.63 mm vs 8.08 mm) and lower incidence of donor site morbidity (7.48% vs 22.01%) than HT autografts. There was a statistically significant mean difference (MD) favoring PLT autografts in the modified Cincinnati score (MD, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.84 to 4.81; P < .0001) and thigh circumference (MD, –7.62 mm; 95% CI, –8.90 to −6.33; P < .00001). Conclusion: This review showed that both PLT and HT autografts are effective options for primary ACLR, with similar functional outcomes and knee stability. PLT autografts offer advantages in terms of graft diameter and donor site morbidity.

Methods A total of 32 patients who underwent revision ACL reconstruction from January 2020 to March 2023 were included. The ipsilateral semitendinosus tendon, gracilis tendons, and the anterior half of the ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon, were harvested to constitute the autograft. In patients in whom the ipsilateral semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were unavailable, the bilateral anterior halves of the peroneus longus tendons were utilised. The ACL+ALS group, with bigger transplant graft (diameter >8 mm, n=17; males 13, females 4; mean age 28.29±7.90 years), ACL combined with ALS reconstruction were performed. The three-in-one group (n=15; males 8, females 7; mean age 29.53±6.73 years) underwent additional iliotibial band (ITB) transposition for grafts with diameter <8 mm (excluding ITB). Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and graft dimensions were compared. Graft healing was evaluated via postoperative MRI. Knee stability was evaluated via the Lachman test. Lysholm knee score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and Tegner activity scale were compared preoperatively, 6-months postoperatively, and 12-months postoperatively, to assess knee function recovery. Results Surgical parameters revealed that the ACL+ALS group had an operative time of 47.82±9.32 min, blood loss of 29.00±6.99 ml, graft diameter of 8.77±0.69 mm; three-in-one group had an operative time of 57.47±10.06 min, blood loss of 36.33±6.99 ml, graft diameter of 8.53±0.52 mm. Although graft diameter showed no significant intergroup difference (t=1.065, P>0.05), the three-in-one group showed significantly longer operative times and greater blood loss (t=2.815, P=0.009; t=2.746, P=0.010). The average follow-up time of the ACL+ALS group was 19.47±5.25 months (range, 12-28 months), whereas the three-in-one group was 20.40±6.50 months (range, 12-32 months). Postoperative MRI showed continuous and homogeneous graft signals in both groups at 6 and 12 months. Lachman test showed negative in 15 cases, grade I in 2 cases in the ACL+ALS group; and negative in 14 cases, grade I in 1 case in the three-in-one group. Both groups exhibited significant improvement from preoperative status (P<0.001), with no intergroup difference (P=1.000). Functional scores revealed that both groups showed significant improvement in Lysholm, IKDC, and Tegner scores at 6 and 12 months (P<0.05 vs. preoperative), with no intergroup differences (P>0.05). In KOOS subscales, the three-in-one group had significantly lower scores than the ACL+ALS group in pain (88.89±5.75 vs. 94.77±3.79 at 6 months; 89.26±5.93 vs. 96.41±3.22 at 12 months) and sports/recreation (71.33±12.32 vs. 83.53±9.31 at 6 months; 73.67±13.43 vs. 88.24±8.65 at 12 months; P<0.05).

However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. Methods: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8 mm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10 mm with a graft tube, compression to 9 mm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. Results: Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95 % CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608 N (SD: 233.12; 95 % CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037). Group 0 (native 8 mm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341 N (SD: 936.67; 95 % CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (p = 0.196). Conclusions: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9 mm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8 mm grafts.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,346-350,,"(Calvo Rodriguez R.; Gonzalez Duque W., doctorwaldogonzalez@gmail.com; Figueroa Poblete D.; Calvo Mena R.)

It is functionally and anatomically subdivided into anteromedial and posterolateral bundles. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common sports injuries and one of the most commonly treated conditions of the knee in the young. Sports such as soccer account for most of these injuries in the world. Although ACL injuries are common, there is still considerable variation in their management. If left untreated, this may lead to functional instability, secondary osteoarthritis, and increased risk of further meniscal of same knee joint injuries. Aim: To Study Functional Outcome Of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft At Tertiary Care Centre. Material and methods: The study was a prospective study conducted on a minimum of 34 patients in each group enlisting in the casualty or inpatient department of orthopaedics at Sri Lakshmi Narayana Institute of Medical Sciences medical college and tertiary health care centre. Only those patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. All the patients was explained about the surgical procedure, the purpose of the study and Informed consent was taken. Patients was evaluated on the basis of history, clinical examination and follow up for wound check, suture removal on 2nd week and range of motion and radiological work up on 3,6,9 month follow up. Functional outcome for Knee: 1) Tegner-Lysholm scoring system, 2) IKDC subjective assessment score. Functional outcome for ankle: 1) AOFAS score. Results: Mean age was 24.2+1.3years. Majority 65% were males. Common mode of injury was sports 58%, followed by motor bike accident 27%. Present study concludes that Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Peronius Longus Tendon Graft had an excellent functional Outcome. The morbidity was very less. Post operative thigh circumference difference as well as inversion and eversion of ankle was also negligible.

The study further evaluates the viability of the PLT autograft as a non-inferior alternative to the conventional HT autograft. METHOD: We independently searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science for all relevant articles from inception to March 2025, in only the English language. Clinical outcomes included: IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, Tegner-Lysholm score, Visual-Analog-Scale (VAS) score, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Modified Cincinnati score, graft diameter, thigh circumference, graft harvest time, Knee laxity & stability (Lachman test, Pivot Shift test, and Anterior Drawer test), and Donor-site morbidity. Funnel plots were used to detect publication bias. All statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.1.3). RESULTS: A total of 25 studies, 9 RCTs, and 16 cohort studies containing 1944 patients were included in this analysis. No statistically significant differences were observed between PLT and HT autografts in functional outcomes, including Tegner scores, Lysholm scores, Tegner-Lysholm scores, VAS scores, or objective measures of knee stability and laxity across all follow-up periods. Notably, the PLT group demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the HT group, including significantly larger graft diameter, reduced graft harvesting time, improved Modified Cincinnati Scores at both 12- and 24-month follow-ups, and lower donor-site morbidity rates. Despite significantly higher IKDC scores in the PLT group at 6 months postoperatively, no significant differences were observed at 12-, and 18, 24, or 36-month follow-up. Conversely, PLT groups had slightly lower AOFAS scores at 12 or 24 months follow-up than the HT group. CONCLUSION: The PLT autograft demonstrates comparable clinical outcomes to HT autograft in ACL reconstruction while offering distinct advantages, including significantly larger graft diameter, reduced harvest time, and lower donor-site morbidity. These benefits, coupled with equivalent postoperative functional results, position the PLT autograft as a promising alternative to traditional HT autograft. Long-term follow-up and higher-quality studies are needed to support our results and further investigate the differences between PLT autograft and HT autograft.

The purpose of our study is to evaluate how good an alternative peroneus longus tendon (PLT) can be when used as a graft in primary ACLR by comparing the functional outcomes of patients undergoing ACLR with PLT versus Hamstring tendon (HT). Materials and Methods: Quasi-experimental study involving 40 patients each in the PLT group and HT group was performed. The knee functional outcomes were compared using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Tegner Lysholm (TL) knee score measured preoperatively, at 3-, 6-, and 24-month post-surgery. Ankle site morbidity was measured by the foot and ankle disability index (FADI) score and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score. Results: IKDC score in PLT group and HT group was 59.3 ± 16.08 and 48.25 ± 15.81 preoperatively, and it improved to 97.5 ± 2.58 and 92.8 ± 5.12 at 24 months, respectively. The median TL scores were 68.5 (Interquartile range [IQR] 42.3-80) and 71.5 (IQR 62.3-77) and improved to 100 (IQR 96-100) and 100 (IQR 98-100) at 24 months in PLT and HT groups, respectively. FADI and AOSFA scores for the ankle were 100 preoperatively. They dropped to 98.05 ± 1.96 and 98.05 ± 2.24 at 3 months after PLT harvest. Both the scores improved to 100 by 6 months. Graft diameter averaged at 8.78 ± 0.95 mm in the PLT group and 8.12 ± 1.10 mm in the HT group. Conclusion: Harvesting PLT is relatively easier and faster, yielding sufficient-sized tendons consistently compared to HTs. Both performed similarly in regard to patient-reported outcome measures measured and followed over 2 years. No graft failures were there in both the groups. We conclude that PLTs perform similar to HT autografts when used for primary ACLR without any associated ankle site morbidity.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,174-178,,2,6,,J. Arthrosc.

Of late, the use of Peroneus longus tendon has shown promising results. Indian population is predominantly kneeling population where squatting and sitting crossed are associated with daily living activities. This study involves the comparative analysis of the morbidities associated with both the grafts and the choice of autograft based on the Indian population needs. Methods: A Comparative cohort study was conducted on 60 patients who underwent ACL Reconstruction during 2022-2023.The patients were randomly assigned for either peroneus longus or hamstring autograft. After a follow-up of one year, the donor site morbidities were assessed using Lysholm score for knee and FADI (Foot and Ankle Disability Index) for ankle joint. Results: A significant statistical difference (p value = <0.001) was seen in the mean time required to harvest hamstring and peroneal grafts. After a mean follow up of 14.3 months (range 13-20 months), in patients with hamstring graft, the mean post operative Lysholm score was 89.6 ± 4.37 and in patients where peroneal graft was used, the mean score was 90.7± 3.9. Although the scores were statistically insignificant (p = 0.03), 20% of patients with hamstring graft, recorded VAS pain score >7/10 while deep squatting and loading heavy weights compared to peroneal graft patients with 6.7%. FADI scores of the donor side (97.9 ± 2.32) and contralateral side (99 ± 2.32) in patients with peroneal graft showed statistically insignificant results (p value = 0.06). Conclusion: Owing to the graft diameter, robust quality, tensile strength and lesser knee joint morbidity, Peroneus longus can be considered as a better alternative autograft to the Indian population.

This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5 ± 2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8 ± 9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30° flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9 ± 26.9- 71.3 ± 11.5, p < 0.001) and Lysholm (59.9 ± 28.5-80.5 ± 11.2, p = 0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values.

Summary: PL also provides longer harvested tendon length, thicker graft diameter, a longer graft and better functional outcomes after preparation for AI-ACLR, as compared to ST. Data: Introduction: The AI-ACLR has been studied by many authors using various graft options e.g. STG, ST, allograft, synthetic graft etc. Peroneus longus has not been assessed till now in AI-ACLR. We designed this study to assess the feasibility of PL tendon in AI- ACLR, compare various intraoperative and postoperative parameters with AI-ACLR done using ST graft. We have also described our modified technique of graft preparation which is more reproducible and does not require to adjust the tibial tunnel drilling depth. Material and methods: The study was conducted from January 2021 to December 2022. It was a prospective case control study with patients followed up for minimum 18 months. Patients having clinically and MRI proven ACL tears, aged between 18 to 50 years were included in the study. Patients having multiligament injuries, any fracture, meniscal injuries, pre-existing osteoarthritis of knee or BMI 30 kg/m2 were excluded from study. 57 patients were enrolled for the study. Patients were non-randomly divided into two groups according to the graft source. Group 1: operated with peroneus longus (PL) tendon graft; Group 2: operated using the semitendinosus (ST) tendon graft. All patients underwent AI-ACLR using our modified technique. 46 patients completed the followup and were included in final analysis (Group 1, n= 35; Group 2, n= 11). Results: Mean Age was 28 (17 - 36) years. Preoperative clinical examination was done in all the patients. Lachmann test was positive grade 2 in 10 (21.7%) patients and grade 3 in 36 (78.3%) patients. Anterior drawer was positive grade 2 in 14 (30.4%) patients and grade 3 in 32 (69.6%) patients. Pivot shift was grade 2 positive in 15 (32.6 %) patients and grade 3 in 31 (67.4 %) patients. The average time since injury till the surgery was 9.26 15.83 months (range 1–70 months). The mean graft length was 69.37 1.91 mm (65-75 mm). Mean surgical time was 60.3 8.75 minutes (range 47 – 75 minutes). Average followup duration was 24 4.8 months (range 18-29). The harvested tendon length was significantly longer in Group 1 (31.51 ± 2.41mm vs 29.0 ± 2.49mm) (P=0.005). Group 1 also had significantly thicker graft diameter (P=0.021) (8.87±1.16mm vs 8.09 ± 0.30mm), better followup KOOS score (P<0.001; 68.86 ± 6.1 vs 60.09 ± 5.65), Lysholm score (P=0.038; 69.46 ± 4.62 vs 65.73 ± 6.25) and IKDC score (P=0.045; 59.26 ± 3.81 vs 56.18 ± 5.65). The followup VAS score was better in Group 2 (1.34 ± 0.54 vs 1.36 ± 0.51) but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.910). The mean surgical time was slightly less in Group 1 (59.89 ± 9.32min vs 61.64 ± 6.82min) but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.506). Conclusion: Our modified technique of AI-ACLR using PL autograft provides significantly better functional scores with no loosening of graft and with no major complications, at minimum 18 months followup as compared to ST autograft. Use of PL also provides longer harvested tendon length, thicker graft diameter, a longer graft after preparation for AI-ACLR.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,,12,,J.

Methods: It was a prospective study which included 40 patients with ACL tears who presented to the outpatient department (OPD) and emergency department of Government Medical College, Patiala. All participants underwent ACL reconstruction surgery utilizing a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft via an arthroscopic single-bundle technique. Functional evaluation was done by International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Results: The study involved 40 patients with ACL tears, predominantly young males (mean age 27.85±7.65 y), with 82.50% affected on the right side. The majority of injuries were due to roadside accidents (42.50%) and sports (37.50%). Significant differences in knee flexion were observed between affected (121.27±3.93°) and unaffected sides (124.92±3.51°, p<0.0001). Pre-operative VAS scores reflecting severe pain (7.02±0.92) decreased substantially post-operation to 1.90±0.90 (p<0.00001). Functional outcomes showed significant improvement over time, with no significant difference in ankle eversion between the sides (p = 0.34). Conclusion: The PLT emerges as a promising autograft option for ACL reconstruction, particularly in multi-ligament injuries and revision cases, delivering excellent clinical outcomes comparable to traditional grafts. The PLT graft effectively restores knee stability while preserving range of motion along with muscle strength in the ipsilateral ankle, highlighting its viability as a suitable alternative with minimal complications and donor site morbidity.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,33-36,,3,17,,Intern.

Chronic patellar tendon ruptures are challenging to manage due to the proximal retraction of the patella, contracture, atrophy of the quadriceps muscle and scarring of the surrounding tissues. Delayed primary repair of patellar tendon tears with autologous soft-tissue graft augmentation is an effective surgical technique for restoring knee extensor function and structural integrity in cases where immediate repair is not feasible. This case report discusses two cases in which the patellar tendon tear was neglected, resulting in the loss of both extension and flexion of the knee, thus causing difficulties in daily living. The patients presented late to the orthopaedic Outpatient Department (OPD) with patellar tendon injuries, which were treated by delayed primary repair with soft-tissue autograft augmentation utilising semitendinosus grafts. This study highlights the fact that this approach provides strong tendon reinforcement, minimises the risk of re-rupture and promotes robust tendon healing by leveraging the biological benefits of autologous tissue.

This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length ≥ 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump ≥ 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. RESULTS: In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length ≥ 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,175,,1,25,,BMC Surg,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12893-025-02913-w,,adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; comparative study; convalescence; female; human; male; procedures; surgery; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; young adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, concerns remain regarding long-term functional impairments of the foot and ankle after harvesting a full-thickness PLT. Purpose: To evaluate long-term donor site morbidity in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with harvested PLT autografts, and all eligible patients were invited to participate in a clinical examination at the hospital. To evaluate their range of motion, all included patients underwent a physical examination. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). To evaluate foot and ankle structural changes, the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), arc height index (AHI), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (LTFMA), calcaneal pitch angle (CPA), and metatarsal angle (MA) were measured in the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side. Results: A total of 26 patients who were available for the final follow-up were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the final follow-up was 45.7 ± 9.5 years. The mean follow-up time was 19.5 ± 3.4 years. AOFAS scores were excellent in 92.3% of patients (n = 24) and good in 7.7% (n = 2). The mean FAAM-ADL score was 99.6 ± 1.86. The mean FAAM-S score was 98.1 ± 5.94. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side for any of the measured parameters—including the IMA, HVA, AHI, LTFMA, CPA, and MA. Conclusion: This study demonstrated good to excellent long-term patient-reported outcomes and negligible radiographic changes after harvesting the full thickness PLT compared with the contralateral side. These long-term data strongly support PLT harvesting as an alternative graft choice and suggest that this method does not alter the natural history of foot and ankle structures.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,4,13,,Orthop.

The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft.

Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. Presentation of case: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0–120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. Discussion: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. Conclusion: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation.

Early identification of HBV-LC risk is essential for timely intervention. This study develops and compares nine machine learning (ML) models to predict HBV-LC risk in CHB patients using routine clinical and laboratory data. A retrospective analysis was conducted involving 777 CHB patients, with 50.45% (392/777) progressing to HBV-LC. Admission data consisted of 52 clinical and laboratory variables, with missing values addressed using multiple imputation. Feature selection utilized Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm, identifying 24 key variables. The evaluated ML models included XGBoost, logistic regression (LR), LightGBM, random forest (RF), AdaBoost, Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The data set was partitioned into an 80% training set (n = 621) and a 20% independent testing set (n = 156). Cross-validation (CV) facilitated hyperparameter tuning and internal validation of the optimal model. Performance metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Brier score, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The RF model demonstrated superior performance, with AUCs of 0.992 (training) and 0.907 (validation), while the reconstructed model achieved AUCs of 0.944 (training) and 0.945 (validation), maintaining an AUC of 0.863 in the testing set. Calibration curves confirmed a strong alignment between observed and predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis indicated that the RF model provided the highest net benefit across threshold probabilities. The SHAP algorithm identified RPR, PLT, HBV DNA, ALT, and TBA as critical predictors. This interpretable ML model enhances early HBV-LC prediction and supports clinical decision-making in resource-limited settings.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,3,97,,J. Med.

Methods: In a single-center retrospective observational study, the effects of different postinterventional protamine doses on the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, platelet count (PLT), and hemoglobin (Hb) were analyzed in consecutive patients who underwent high-dose heparin administration (>300 U/kg body weight) and extracorporeal circulation for chemosaturation treatment. Due to the multiple treatments of individual patients, linear mixed-effects models were applied. Results: Thirty-one patients underwent 90 chemosaturation interventions, 68 (75.6%) of which involved heparin reversal with protamine. All investigated variables showed significant postinterventional alterations, while protamine use was associated with significantly lower aPTT, lower INR, higher PT, and higher fibrinogen levels, whereas PLT and Hb levels were comparable to those in procedures without protamine use. After adjustment for aPTT, significant independent effects of protamine remained for the INR and PT. Dose-dependent effects of protamine were observed for reductions in aPTT and an increase in fibrinogen levels, which were confirmed after adjustment for the heparin dose. A 10% higher protamine dose resulted in a 3% decrease in aPTT and a 4% increase in fibrinogen. An increase of 0.1 in the protamine-to-heparin ratio was associated with an increase of 9% in fibrinogen. Conclusions: The present results suggest that protamine contributes to the normalization of the aPTT, INR, PT, and fibrinogen levels. Further prospective studies should be conducted to determine optimal dosing ratios.",2025,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,2,15,,Clin.

Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and stability of the knee compared with conservative management. Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR. The advantages of the PLT graft include a long length, large cross-sectional area, and a simple harvesting technique.

The over-the-top (OTT) technique offers a single-stage solution by avoiding femoral tunnel drilling. However, its main limitation is the reduced graft diameter, typically between 5.5 and 7 mm, which may be insufficient in revision settings. This Technical Note describes an augmentation of the classic OTT technique using a peroneus longus tendon allograft wrapped around preserved-insertion hamstring tendons, achieving graft diameters exceeding 8 mm. Standard arthroscopic portals are used to prepare a standard tibial tunnel, whereas a lateral femoral approach is performed to prepare the OTT point. Femoral fixation is secured with staples, and a lateral extra-articular tenodesis is performed to enhance rotational stability. This combined intra- and extra-articular reconstruction allows single-stage revision even in the presence of tunnel enlargement, improving biomechanical strength and potentially accelerating biological integration through preservation of the tibial insertion.

Understanding the changes in the electromyographic activity of the lower extremity muscles in individuals with DKV helps trainers design ACL injury prevention exercises. Therefore, the present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the muscle activation of the lower limb muscles in individuals with DKV during single-leg and overhead squats. Methods: Articles with titles, abstracts, and full texts were searched and screened independently by two reviewers in the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases, without restrictions on publication date and in English using specified keywords from their inception to January 5, 2024. The quality of articles was evaluated using a modified version of the Downs and Black quality checklist. This meta-analysis used mean difference (MD) to compare the muscle activity patterns between individual with DKV and healthy individuals. Heterogeneity was detected using I-square (I2) test. Results: In total, four papers with 130 participants were included in the study. Evidence showed a significant difference between the DKV group and the healthy group regarding the activities of the adductor magnus (MD: 6.25, P < 0.001), vastus medialis (MD: 13.23, P = 0.002), vastus lateralis (MD: 11.71, P = 0.004), biceps femoris (MD: 3.06, P = 0.003), and tibialis anterior muscles (MD: 8.21, P = 0.02). Additionally, muscle activity in the DKV group was higher than that in the healthy group. Conclusions: This meta-analysis reveals distinct muscle activation patterns in individuals with dynamic knee valgus (DKV), with increased activity in key muscles suggesting compensatory responses.

ACL reconstruction has been recognized as the most common procedure to restore knee stability. One of the main drawbacks of standard implant is that the medical costs incurred are often beyond the reach of most patients, so patients who need ACL reconstruction surgery must find other financially affordable alternatives. Due to the many knee joint complications involving patellar and hamstring tendon grafts in ACL reconstruction, the new proposed solution is anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This research was an analytical study with a cross-sectional observational design. The sample in this study compared patients diagnosed with ACL rupture who received ACL reconstruction treatment using a modified implant with a hamstring tendon autograft and a peroneus longus tendon autograft. The sample was examined using the consecutive sampling technique by tracing medical record data, used as secondary data, and through the distribution of the Lysholm Knee and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring questionnaires. RESULTS: Out of 69 samples that met the inclusion criteria, 45 were hamstring autograft samples, and 24 were peroneus autograft samples. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of Lysholm Knee Score (P=0.135), International Knee Documentation Committee Score (P=0.352), use of a mobile aider (P=0.488), power grading (P=0.905), and range of motion of the knee (P=0.110).

The present study was conducted for comparing the outcome of Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction by PLT vs Semitendinosus graft. Materials & methods:A cohort of 40 patients diagnosed with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, confirmed through both clinical assessment and radiographic imaging, underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Of these patients, 20 received semitendinosus grafts, while the remaining 20 were treated with peroneus longus tendon grafts. All surgical procedures were performed under spinal or epidural anesthesia, utilizing a tourniquet, and the postoperative recovery was without complications. A uniform rehabilitation protocol was implemented for all patients following the ACL reconstruction. Postoperative outcome was evaluated using Lysholm score. Results:Mean age of the patients of Semitendinosus grafts group and PLT group was 38.3 years and 40.7 years respectively. Mean postoperative Lysholm score among patients of the Semitendinosus grafts group and PLT group was 91.3 and 93.7 respectively.

The Lysholm score was statistically significant at all intervals (p>0.001). The mean KLT score pre-operatively was 1.4cm and found to be 0.26 cm at 6-month post-op. There was no significant (p>0.001) change in AOFAS score between pre-op to 1month, 3month & 6 month (94.6 ± 0.7). Conclusion: The peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction for Indian patients.

The following study aims to compare the functional outcome after ACLR using PLT and Hamstring tendon (HT) autografts. Methodology; In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed in 51 patients using quadrupled HT autograft between October 2019 and December 2020, and in another group, ACLR was performed in 30 patients using PLT autograft between April 2021 and May 2022. The same surgical technique, fixation method and post-operative protocol was followed in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were measured using the Lysholm score, Tegner Score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score pre-operatively as well as 6 months after surgery. Ankle donor site abnormalities was assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS). Results; A total of 81 patients (51 in HT group, 30 in PLT group) were evaluated with a minimum follow up of 6 months. Both groups showed good clinical outcome post ACLR. The PLT group demonstrated better Tegner Score (7.33 ± 1.06 vs 6.51 ± 2.64) and subjective IKDC score (87.16 ± 5.41 vs 81.22 ± 9.06). Lysholm score was found to be similar in both groups (88.70 ± 8.57 in PLT group vs 85.39 ± 8.87 in HT group). Assessment of AOFAS showed no significant donor site morbidity in the PLT group. Conclusion; PLT can be a valuable alternative to HT during ACLR due to its strength, ease of harvesting and minimal donor site morbidity.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,"(Nemani M., nemani.mudit@gmail.com; Devgun A.; Rathore R.)

The choice of graft is principal in providing optimal knee stability after surgery. Peroneus longus tendon PLT is an autograft modality that offers unique benefits for ACL reconstruction cases. Aim of the Work: Our study was conducted to evaluate. PLT as an autograft modality benefits in ACL reconstruction and asses if this modality has any complications. Post-operative biomechanical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score. Materials and Methods: In our metaanalysis, 11 studies were included evaluating the outcome of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with the Peroneus Longus Tendon. The total number of patients was 600 patients. The mean age was 29 years. Results: The mean follow up time was 24 month our results revealed that: functional outcomes using PLT autograft were satisfactory. There was a significant difference between the mean pre-operative and postoperative IKDC scores with a mean difference 30.50, statistically significant decrease in AOFAS after PLT harvest was identified, PLT harvest does not appear to affect foot and ankle function to any clinically significant degree. In our meta-analysis there was non significant decrease in FADI score. The use of peroneus longus tendon graft in ACL reconstruction did not cause significant changes or major complications at the donor ankle site. Complications in the form of infection were detected only in three studies. Re-rupture was detected only in one study. Conclusion: ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft has an excellent functional score. Excellent results were achieved in both the knee and the donor site according to the Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS).

The ankle motion pattern plays a crucial role in absorbing the load shocks during SL, but the effect on the knee joint is not yet clear. This work aims to explore the effects of different ankle plantarflexion angles during SL on the risk of knee-related injury. Methods: Thirty healthy male subjects were recruited to perform SL biomechanics tests, and one standard subject was selected to develop the finite element model of foot-ankle-knee integration. The joint impact force was used to evaluate the impact loads on the knee at various landing angles. The internal load forces (musculoskeletal modeling) and stress (finite element analysis) around the knee joint were simulated and calculated to evaluate the risk of knee-related injury during SL. To more realistically revert and simulate the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury mechanics, we developed a knee musculoskeletal model that reverts the ACL ligament to a nonlinear short-term viscoelastic mechanical mechanism (strain rate-dependent) generated by the dense connective tissue as a function of strain. Results: As the ankle plantarflexion angle increased during landing, both the peak knee vertical impact force (p = 0.001) and ACL force (p = 0.001) decreased significantly. The maximum von Mises stress of ACL, meniscus, and femoral cartilage decreased as the ankle plantarflexion angle increased. The overall range of variation in ACL stress was small and was mainly distributed in the femoral and tibial attachment regions, as well as in the mid-lateral region. Conclusion: The current findings revealed that the use of larger ankle plantarflexion angles during landing may be an effective solution to reduce knee impact load and the risk of rupture of the medial femoral attachment area in the ACL. The findings of this study have the potential to offer novel perspectives in the optimized application of landing strategies, thus giving crucial theoretical backing for decreasing the risk of knee-related injury.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,"(Xu D.; Zhou H.; Wang M.; Chon T.-E.; Baker J.S.; Gu Y., guyaodong@nbu.edu.cn) Faculty of Sports Science, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China",180,,Comput.

While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population. Matreials and methods: This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients. Results: 20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 ± 1.34 and 98.5 ± 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 ± 9.43 and 88.75 ± 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886±22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 ± 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio.

Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. Hypothesis: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL–Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. Results: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 ± 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged ≤25 years (P =.007). Neither donor age (≤40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P >.05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. Conclusion: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,8,12,,Orthop.

However, recent studies endorse the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft as a viable alternative. To evaluate this, we systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy of PLT against HT autografts. Our search encompassed Cochrane, Embase, OVID, PubMed, and Scopus databases for RCTs comparing outcomes of PLT and HT autografts in ACL reconstruction. Primary outcomes included Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, while secondary outcomes involved American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, graft diameters and donor-site complications. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) and heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics. 683 patients from 6 RCTs were included, with 338 (49.5%) patients treated with PLT autografts. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 30 months. Despite lower preoperative Lysholm scores in the PLT group, no significant differences were observed at 6 and 12 months. Although preoperative and 6-month IKDC scores were lower in the PLT group, no significant differences were found at 12 and 24 months. AOFAS scores showed no significant preoperative difference, but slightly lower scores were noted in the PLT group at 12 or 24 months. There was no significant difference in graft diameter, while donor-site complications were fewer in the PLT group.

PURPOSE: To create an open-access data set on the morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of clinically important tendons and ligaments of the lower limb, using consistent methodologies, to enable direct tendon/ligament comparisons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nineteen distinct lower limb tendons and ligaments were retrieved from 8 fresh-frozen human cadavers (5 male, 3 female; aged 49-65 years) including Achilles, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, fibularis (peroneus) longus, fibularis (peroneus) brevis, flexor hallucis longus, extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, flexor digitorum longus, quadriceps, patellar, semitendinosus, and gracilis tendons; anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments; and 10 mm-wide grafts from the contralateral quadriceps and patellar tendons. Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSAUS], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression. RESULTS: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSAUS, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons. CONCLUSION: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties-key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models.

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the effects of different graft types on muscle strength, joint stability, functional activities, and return to sports in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. METHODS: Related studies were searched through PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, CNKI, and WANFANG databases.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Patients with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts should strengthen centrifugal contraction exercises of quadriceps muscle, and pay attention to the recovery of quadriceps muscle endurance and explosive power in the later stage of rehabilitation. Compared with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts and hamstring tendon grafts, significantly fewer patients with quadriceps tendon grafts met regression criteria within 5-8 months, and a longer training plan should be developed, with the training cycle lasting as long as possible to more than 3 years. The selection of hamstring tendon grafts should strengthen the hamstring muscle strength training under multiple angles, especially the cycle of bending the knee above 60° until at least 18 weeks after surgery. Patients who choose peroneus longus tendon graft should strengthen the muscle strength around the ankle, mainly the plantar muscle strength. In the selection of allograft, attention should be paid to the reduction of tension resistance of 20% after the graft is disinfected by low-dose radiation, so attention should be paid to knee stability training. Patients who choose artificial ligament grafts can gradually enhance quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength training within 3-6 weeks, pay attention to early proprioceptive exercises, and conduct targeted training on balance, jumping, and flexibility.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,2753-2758,,17,28,,Chin.

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and complications between revision ACLR using allografts and PLT autografts. Materials and methods: Fifty-nine patients who underwent arthroscopic revision of ACLR with complete clinical follow-ups between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Allograft was used in 44 of these patients, and PLT autograft was used in 15 of them. Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, Lachman, and anterior drawer tests were performed after a mean follow-up of 60 months (range: 19–116). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to evaluate the donor ankle functions. Clinical outcomes and complications were compared between groups. Results: Both groups showed significantly improved functional outcomes compared to their preoperative assessments. However, both groups had similar clinical results at the final follow-up, including Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity scale, knee range of motion, return to sports, time to return to daily activities, and rate of re-rupture. No major complications were seen in any of the patients. The AOFAS score was 99.13 ± 2.64 in the PLT autograft group without loss of ankle muscle strength, deformity, instability, and permanent iatrogenic neurovascular injuries. The cumulative cost of the allograft group was significantly higher than the PLT autograft group. Conclusions: The PLT autograft might be an alternative autograft option to allografts due to similar clinical outcomes, low donor site morbidity, and reduced cost in ACLR revisions, especially if the primary ACLR was performed using grafts harvested around the knee.

Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system—Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. Results: One year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). Conclusion: ACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,1317-1326,,6,16,,Orthop.

Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation. Conclusion: This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,2703-2710,,6,144,,Arch.

Methods: A total of 207 parturients who delivered via vagina were divided into PPH group (n=102) and non-PPH group (n=105). The PPH group was further divided into mild PPH group and severe PPH group. The differences of Fib, platelet (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), D-dimer (D-D), hemoglobin (HGB) and neonatal weight (Nw) between the two groups were compared to explore the significance of these indexes in predicting PPH. Results: Fib, PLT and PDW in PPH group were significantly lower than those in non-PPH group, while D-D and Nw in PPH group were significantly higher than those in non-PPH group. In the binary logistic regression model, we found that Fib, D-D and Nw were independently related to PPH. The risk of PPH increased by 9.87 times for every 1 g/L decrease in Fib. The cut-off value of Fib is 4.395 (sensitivity 0.705, specificity 0.922). The AUC value of PPH predicted by Fib combined with D-D and Nw was significantly higher than that of PPH predicted by Fib (p<0.05, 95 % CI 0.00313-0.0587). Conclusions: Fib, D-D and Nw have good predictive value for PPH of vaginal delivery, among which Fib is the best.

Rituximab (RTX) can deplete CD20+ peripheral B cells and Telitacicept (TA) is a dual target inhibitor targeted both BAFF and APRIL. The strategy of TA following RTX immunotherapy is worth discussing in the treatment of APS. Objectives: This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TA following RTX therapy for refractory/severe APS. Methods: This prospective study enrolled PAPS/SAPS patients were treated with RTX monotherapy or a sequential therapy, that was 200-500mg RTX infusion after screening, then evaluated 4 weeks later (0w) and TA injection (mainly 160mg ih qw) for 24 weeks (24w). The standard background were glucocorticoid (GC), hydroxychloroquine, and anticoagulants/ antiplatelet medications. The complete remission rate (CR) was the proportion of increased antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) or lupus anticoagulant (LA) value decreased to normal range and overall remission rate (OR) was the aPL titers decreased into two times above the normal value or LA decreased to normal range. The incidence of new APS related clinical events, overall remission ratio of thrombocytopenia (TP), and adverse events (AE) were also analysis. Results: There were 21 patients in RTA+TA group and 20 in RTX group who completed this study. During the screening period (before the use of RTX), the triple positivity of aPL in the study was 53.7%, among which the aβ2GPI-IgG showed the highest positivity rate at 95.1%. It was observed that the stratification of aβ2GP1-IgG and ACL-IgG were higher in the RTX+TA group than in RTX. Among the 4 difference clinical subgroups, the patients only with thrombotic APS (TAPS) showed the highest positive rate of LA, and much higher values of LA, aβ2GPI-IgG, ACL-IgG compared to TP, TP+TAPS and Obstetric APS (OAPS) subgroups. After RTA +TA immunotherapy, the values of these aPLs in TAPS group were still higher than others. The median values of ACLIgG and ACL-IgM decreased sharply from 0w to 24w in the TAPS group with additional TA treatment (Table 1). With 24 weeks treatment, the new clinical events occurring ratio was significant lower in the RTX+TA group than in the RTX group (1/21 vs. 6/20) (Figure 1A). There were eight patients with TP in each treatment group. The PLT count in the RTX+TA group was significantly lower than that in the RTX group during the screening period, while at baseline and 24 weeks timepoint, the data in the RTX+TA group were higher than in the RTX group. The OR rates of aβ2GPI-IgA, aβ2GPI-IgM, ACL-IgM, ACL-IgA, and ACL-IgG in the RTX+TA group were more than 50%, especially the OR of aβ2GPI-IgA and aβ2GPI-IgM were significantly higher than RTX group. It was obviously that all aPL values in the RTX+TA group were significantly lower compared to both the screening and baseline timepoint (after RTX treatment and before TA administration). However, in the RTX group, only the LA value at 24 weeks significantly decreased from that of the screening timepoint (Figure 1B-1H). The decreased values were also different between the two groups, the reduction of aPL values was higher in the RTX+TA group. Both groups received a GC dose of 10 mg/d during the screening period, and the RTX+TA group exhibited a lower dose than the RTX group at 24 weeks (5.0 mg/d vs 7.5 mg/d, p=0.011). AE was mild in both treatment patients, including 14 RTX infusion-related reactions and two RTX-associated secondary infections, primarily occurring within one month after infusion. TA injection had 5 slight and one moderate local reactions. No additional infections were reported after the administration of TA. Conclusion: In this 24w observational study, TA followed with RTX therapy was a promising strategy for refractory/severe APS. This immunotherapy strategy effectively reduced the incidence of new-onset APS-related events and lowered aPL values without increasing the number of new infections using TA.

Aim of the Work: This study aims to assess the efficiency of PLT autograft as a good alternative graft choice for ACLR and to outline the advantages and disadvantages of its use. Methodology: We searched the literature through PUBMED, Cochrane library, Medscape, direct science, JBJS and Google scholar with publication date restricted to 10 years range from 2012-2022. English literature of prospective studies only were selected with strict inclusion criteria where human studies undergoing Arthroscopic ACLR using PLT autograft which commenting on clinical +/- imaging outcomes and repeated studies excluded. Eleven studies were included satisfying the predetermined inclusion criteria with total of 564 patients. Four literatures compared ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus Hamstring tendon,1 literature versus Semitendinosus graft and another versus Patellar tendon. After pooling of collected data from the desired search studies, the relative risk of each of intended outcome measures of interest was calculated and tabulated according to IKDC and AOFAS score. Results: In 4 literatures, in total, outcomes of 108 PLT versus 129 HT autografts were analyzed with mean follow up 10.5 months, reported little difference was found between the two grafts in favor of PLT autograft, with mean score 95.58 for PLT versus 91.65 for HT. Outcomes of 15 PLT versus 15 semitendinosus autografts were analyzed. PLT autograft gave better clinical and biomechanical outcomes than semitendinosus graft as mean IKDC score was 91.58 for PLT versus 88.37 for semitendinosus graft. Outcomes of 50 PLT versus 50 Patellar tendon autografts were analyzed and reported that PLT autograft has better IKDC score than patellar tendon autograft (96.8 versus 95.1) and lower graft rupture rate (6% versus 10%). In 5 literatures, in total, outcomes of 189 patients, had ACLR using PLT autograft, were analyzed after mean follow up 12.4 months and revealed that mean IKDC score was increased from 64.7 preoperative to 97.8 postoperative. PLT harvest does not appear to affect foot and ankle function to any clinically significant degree with slightly decreased AOFAS score (96.88 ± 4.95). Conclusion: PLT autograft consider a very promising and ideal graft option for ACLR with excellent functional and biomechanical outcomes.

However, there is a paucity of literature evaluating the effect of PTS on outcomes after combined bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstruction. Purpose: To determine whether differences exist for graft failure rates or PRO scores based on PTS after combined bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstruction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All patients who underwent combined ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction between 2000 and 2020 at our institution were identified. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, knee dislocation grade 5 injuries, concomitant osteotomy procedures, and <2 years of clinical follow-up. Demographic and outcomes data were collected from our prospectively gathered multiligamentous knee injury database. Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were analyzed in relation to PTS. Outcomes were compared for patients with a PTS above and below the mean for the total cohort, PTS >12° versus <12°, positive versus negative Lachman test at follow-up, and positive versus negative posterior drawer test at follow-up. Results: A total of 98 knees in 98 patients were included in the study, with a mean clinical follow-up of 5.1 years (median, 4.6 years; range, 2-16 years). The mean PTS was 8.7° (range, 0.4°-16.9°). Linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between PTS and IKDC or Lysholm scores. Patients with a PTS above the mean of 8.7° trended toward lower IKDC (P =.08) and Lysholm (P =.06) scores. Four patients experienced ACL graft failure and 5 patients experienced PCL graft failure. There were no differences in graft failure rates or PRO scores for patients with a PTS >12°. Patients with a positive Lachman test trended toward higher PTS (9.6° vs 8.5°, P =.15). Conclusion: In this series of bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstructions at midterm follow-up, no differences in graft failures, complications, reoperations, revisions, or PRO scores based on PTS were identified.

The present study aims to quantify the available evidence to support the use of PRP as biological augmentation in ACLR surgery. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science and Embase databases on 10 March 2023. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), written in English, addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR surgery, with no time limitation. A scoping review was performed to map the body of literature by examining the evidence related to specific aspects of patients' treatment and evaluation. Risk of bias evaluation was performed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials Version 2 (RoB 2), while the quality assessment was performed with the use of the Coleman Score. RESULTS: Out of 983 articles retrieved, 23 RCTs on 943 knees were included in this scoping review. PRP was administered in a liquid form in nine studies and clotted in 11 studies, while in three studies both liquid and clotted PRP were used. Hamstring auto/allografts were used in 14 studies, patellar tendon auto/allografts were used in eight studies and one study described ACLR with peroneus longus allografts. The map of the evidence documented high heterogeneity also in terms of surgical technique, objective and subjective outcome measures and radiological assessment, as well as follow-up times ranging from 1 day to 2 years, with virtually no overlapping data among studies neither in terms of treatments nor evaluations. Risk of bias evaluation showed an overall low quality of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR is largely scattered. PRP was produced and applied following different procedures, and high variability was detected across the included studies for every aspect of ACLR surgery and evaluation. Currently, a meaningful comparison of the available studies is not possible as the quantification of the literature results is biased by their heterogeneity. Future studies should provide more standardisation to investigate the benefits of biological augmentation in ACL surgery and confirm the promising yet weak evidence of PRP potential as well as the most suitable application modality, before routine use in clinical practice.

Methods: A comprehensive search of published literature in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and EMBASE databases was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria included patients undergoing ACLR with PLT autograft, inclusion of patient-recorded outcome measures, and availability in English language. Publications that included only biomechanical analysis or ACLR with use of allograft or combination grafts were excluded. Results: A total of 16 studies (Level of Evidence range: I-IV) met inclusion criteria, with follow-up ranging from 3 months to 5 years. In the available case series, patient-reported outcomes ranged from Lysholm = 80.7 to 95.1, International Knee Documentation Committee 78.1 to 95.7. In prospective cohorts and randomized controlled trials, PLT performance was comparable with HT autografts (PLT/HT: Lysholm = 88.3-95.1/86.5-94.9, International Knee Documentation Committee = 78.2-92.5/87.4-93.4). The majority of PLT grafts diameters were equal or greater than HT counterparts with a mean of >8 mm (PLT/HT: 7.0-9.0 mm/7.65-8.5 mm). There was minimal donor-site morbidity associated with PLT harvest. Conclusions: Although limitations exist within the available literature, existing evidence suggests that PLT autograft routinely produces adequately sized grafts with comparable early outcomes to HT autograft and low risk of donor-site morbidity.

ACL injury contribute to approximately 50% of knee injuries .The incidence of ACL ruptures is estimated to be between 30 and 78 per 100,000 people per year . The incidence of ACL ruptures varies depending on a number of factors, including age, sex, sport participation, and genetics. ACL ruptures are most common in young adults, particularly women. The risk of an ACL rupture has been reported as 2-8 times higher for women than for men. A systematic review study found that the risk of ACL injury was highest in football, followed by soccer, basketball, and skiing . Nowadays, Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft is used in orthopaedic surgeries. Some studies reported that PLT graft had maintained a possible more efficient ACL substitute for its tensile strength and regeneration ability after being inserted post-surgery . The PLT graft has additional benefit as it does not cause secondary injury to the knee and its adjacent structures . Ankle proprioception is one of the crucial components contributing to postural control . PLT graft for ACL reconstruction might affect the already compromised body balance by influencing postural stability and ankle stability at the donor ankle site. So, this study will be conducted to assess and compare the effect of ACLreconstruction with PLT graft to the effect of ACL reconstruction with HT graft on ankle stability and postural control . Detailed Description PURPOSE * To assess the effect of ACL reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon autograft on Peak torque of ankle plantarflexors and evertors , Single Leg Stance test time and Star Excursion Balance Test score in patients with ACL reconstruction. * To assess the effect of ACL reconstruction with Hamstring tendon autograft on Peak torque of ankle plantarflexors and evertors , Single Leg Stance test time and Star Excursion Balance Test score in patients with ACL reconstruction. * To compare between the effect of ACL reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon autograft to ACL reconstruction with Hamstring tendon autograft on peak torque of ankle plantarflexors and evertors , Single Leg Stance test time and Star Excursion Balance Test score in patients with ACL reconstruction.

Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. Materials and methods: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft. Results: Clinically, as a mean Lysholm score of all patients, they were revealed to be consecutively high in G1 than in Group 2 at four, six, and eight months. The signal-to-noise ratio from the MRI results showed majority having good healing in G1 group. Conclusions: Based on 6-month MRI, an effective ligamentization (SNR<75) was noticed in 53.33% of patients in the dHACM allograft enhanced group on comparison with 33% in the controls. The overall results show that the augmentation of dHACM allograft to ACL reconstruction yields in good patient outcomes at post-operative follow-up.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,33-41,,1,18,,Malays.

To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. Methods: A single-center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. Results: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/- 0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/- 0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre-op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre-op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre-op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre-op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/- 2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction.

The current review was performed to analyze the available evidence regarding PLT in the arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: A comprehensive search of literature was performed on March 1, 2023 using 5 databases (for manuscripts published between 2010 and 2023). All studies reporting ACL reconstruction with PL graft in adults ≥18 years were considered; and final studies were shortlisted based on specific exclusion criteria. Results: The search identified 684 articles, among which 26 manuscripts were finally selected. PLT has been used in primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR), revision ACLR, ACLR in multiligamentous injuries and those at risk for anterior knee pain. The full-thickness PLT graft is variable in its dimensions with the mean size ranging between 7 and 8.8 mm (half-PLT grafts ≤8.1 mm). The ultimate strength of doubled PLT graft is significantly higher than native ACL and comparable to the quadrupled hamstring. There was statistically insignificant difference in the laxity and functional outcome of knee following ACLR with PLT, as compared with other autografts (p > 0.05). PLT harvest is associated with satisfactory clinical foot and ankle outcomes, as well as excellent regenerative ability. Overall, studies have demonstrated lower complications with PLT (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The dimensions of harvested PLT graft are more consistent than HT. It has similar functional outcome and survival, as compared to other autografts. It also has lower risk for donor-site morbidity and lower complications than HT.

This study aims to explore the changes in the ankle and gait after using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a reconstruction graft for the anterior cruciate ligament. METHODS: A total of 20 patients, 6 males and 14 females, aged 18 to 44 years, with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries, underwent reconstruction using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft between June 2021 and December 2021. The part on which the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was harvested was considered the experimental group, while the contralateral foot was the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups. RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Through our study of the surgical experimental group we have shown that harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon does not affect foot morphology and gait parameters; however, it does impact the gait cycle.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,69,,1,19,,J Orthop Surg Res,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13018-023-04429-6,,anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; autotransplantation; female; human; knee; male; tendon; transplantation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to compare functional outcomes and donor site morbidity between peroneus longus and hamstring autografts for ACL reconstruction. Methodology: Forty patients underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autografts, while another 40 received hamstring tendon autografts. Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up assessments included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, graft diameter measurements, knee stability evaluations, and ankle range of motion assessments. Results: Functional scores (IKDC and Lysholm) showed substantial improvements postoperatively in both groups, with no significant differences between preoperative scores. Graft diameter differed significantly, with the peroneus longus tendon exhibiting a larger diameter. Knee stability, laxity, and ankle range of motion demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusion: Despite variations in graft diameter, both peroneus longus and hamstring tendon autografts yielded comparable functional outcomes and knee stability post-ACL reconstruction. Ankle range of motion remained unaffected following peroneus longus tendon harvesting.

It is a very important ligament in knee which contributes to the stability of the knee joint. Reconstructing ACL is essential to prevent early onset osteoarthritis of the knee joint as well as to have better functional outcome. There are numerous autograft options like bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Hamstring graft and peroneus longus graft with their own merits and demerits. The present study is intended to study the functional outcome follow-ing ACL reconstruction with quadrupled hamstring graft. Methods and materials: Patients with ACL injury and those who have met inclusion and exclusion criteria are included in the study. After thorough pre-op evaluation, the patients are treated with reconstruction of ACL with quadrupled hamstring graft. They are assessed pre-operatively and post-operatively up to 9 months by doing Lachman test, Anterior Drawer test, Pivot shift test and few functional scores like Lysholm knee score and IKDC subjective knee evaluation score. Thus, the functional outcome of knee is assessed. Results: Among the 32 patients, who are included in the study, 28 are males. Right limbs are more commonly involved. In this study, RTA is the most common mechanism of injury. About 10 cases are also associated with meniscal injuries. The average IKDC score among the isolated ACL injury cases is 88.6 and in those associated with meniscal injuries is 86.3. About 75.4% of patients showed better outcome in the study. Conclusion: Anatomical reconstruction of ACL is key for better functional outcomes in knees with ACL injury. Better functional outcome is seen in isolated ACL injuries compared to ACL injuries with meniscal involvement. ACL reconstruction with quadrupled hamstring graft is one of the reliable methods which provides better results. It is not associated with much donor site morbidity.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,595-599,,3,16,,Intl. J. Pharm. Clin.

Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts’ biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozen + 21 kGy gamma irradiation, frozen + 21 kGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4 months) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at −80 °C. All groups were subject to 60 s static creep test with 250 N load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4 months) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam.

Currently the most preferred grafts include the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BPTB) and the hamstring graft. However, there are some significant donor site morbidities associated with these grafts. Thus, we have used peroneus longus tendon as the graft which was found to have similar functional outcomes compared to hamstring graft and assessed functional outcome at the donor site associated with it. Methods: Patients who required a knee ligament reconstruction were selected and Peroneus longus tendon was harvested as graft. The patients were followed up for 12 months post operatively. Functional scoring was done with AOFAS Ankle and Hindfoot scoring and Visual Analogue Scale-Foot and Ankle (VAS-FA) were used. Also, the power of foot eversion and plantar flexion was tested and recorded clinically by MRC grading. Results: 30 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (22 male and 08 female patients). Follow up period was 12 months. The mean pre and postoperative AOFAS-AH score was 99.27 ± 0.94 and 99.13 ± 1.01 respectively at 12 months follow up. The mean pre and postoperative VAS-FA score was 98.53 ± 1.38 and 98.00 ±1.34 respectively at 12 months follow up (p value > 0.05). The 12 months postoperative power of eversion and plantar flexion were grade 5 in all patients. Conclusion: There was no significant difference of functional outcome and muscle power was noted postoperatively (at one year follow up) at the donor site following PLT graft harvest. Also, the surgical procedure of graft harvest was simple with less operative time with early wound healing and no complications postoperatively.

Several graft possibilities are available, including (BPTB), four-strand hamstring autografts, quadriceps tendon, and peroneus longus tendon. Each has both advantages and cons. This study compares the effectiveness of peroneus longus and hamstring tendon autografts for single bundle ACL restoration. Patients and Methods: The study involved 60 patients. Thirty of them had their torn anterior cruciate ligaments reconstructed arthroscopically using hamstring tendons, while the other 30 had their ACLs managed arthroscopically with peroneus longus tendon. The follow-up period lasted at least 12 months. Patients were assessed using IKDC score and Lysholm score. Ankle function was assessed using AOFAS score. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in preoperative and postoperative range of motion improvement in each group as an IKDC score item. However, no statistically significant difference existed between both groups. A statistically significant change in Lysholm scores preoperatively and postoperatively in each group was detected, but there was no statistical difference between groups 1 and 2, either in terms of improvement or percentage improvement. The AOFAS score was used also to assess for any donor site morbidity. No significant difference was detected between both ankles range of motion and no ankle joint dysfunction or problems with sports activities. Conclusion: The current study found that the PL tendon autograft might be considered a safe, effective and a technically easy graft option for ACLR. The research shows no substantial difference in postoperative knee stability or graft failure rate between hamstring and peroneus tendons.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,355-362,,1,60,,Alex.

It is also crucial for balancing valgus and rotational stress. An established and often performed surgical treatment with a low morbidity profile and demonstrated success is ACL reconstruction. Objectives: The present study was designed to study the functional assessment of ACL reconstruction using various grafts. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 18 patients admitted with clinical and radiological deficiency of ACL, Department of Orthopaedics, Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad. Functional assessment of ACL reconstruction using various grafts, assess the functional outcome of arthroscopy-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadrupled semitendinosus tendon graft using endobutton and bioabsorbable interference screw in terms of range of motion, postoperative knee stability, graft site morbidity, subjective knee functions and prospective assessment of functional outcome using tegner lysholm knee scoring system. Results: In our study, the majority of the cases i.e. 14 (77.78%) were in the age group of 21-40 years, followed by 3 (16.66%) cases in the age group 41-60 years. Of 8 cases (44.44%) affected were due to slip and fall. In the present study, hamstring tendon autografts were used in 10 (55.56%) cases, peroneus longus graft was used in 6 (33.33%) cases while bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft was used in 2 (11.11%) cases. Postoperative knee pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale. In two patients in BPTB, 1 (50%) patient had mild pain while flexing the knee and 1 (50%) patient had experienced no knee pain. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results of our study substantiate the similarities between the grafts found in previous reports. Good or excellent results can be obtained in most ACL reconstructions using hamstring tendon autografts or peroneus longus grafts. BPTB autograft is a better graft for sportspersons with highly intense activities and by taking an oblique incision for harvest of BPTB graft the incidence of anterior knee pain has been reduced to minimal or negligent.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,414-421,,4,6,,Int.

This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Material/Methods: ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56±0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44±0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46±3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48±4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. Conclusions: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain. The peroneus longus tendon, with its larger diameter, fewer graft-related complications, and similar knee scores compared to the hamstring group, is considered a suitable alternative graft source.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,"(Gök B., dr.bilalgok@hotmail.com; Tutak Y.)

Recent interest has focused on the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as a potential alternative to hamstring tendons (HT) due to its biomechanical properties and potential advantages. However, comparative studies assessing functional outcomes between PLT and HT in ACLR are lacking. We conducted a cross‐sectional study involving 60 ACL injury cases treated with ACL reconstruction using either hamstring or peroneus longus tendon grafts. Patient selection was randomized, and assessments included preoperative planning, surgery under spinal or combined spinal‐epidural anesthesia, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Functional scores were assessed using the Lysholm Knee Score and IKDC Score at various follow‐up intervals. Both groups showed favorable outcomes in terms of knee stability and functional scores. There were no statistically significant differences in Lysholm and IKDC scores between the two groups at any time point during the follow‐up period. Additionally, postoperative complications did not significantly differ between the groups. The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autografts yields comparable outcomes to hamstring tendon autografts in terms of knee stability and functional scores. The use of peroneus longus tendon grafts may offer advantages such as larger size, satisfactory ankle function preservation and avoidance of potential complications associated with hamstring graft harvesting.

While various autograft options exist for ACL reconstruction, each has associated drawbacks. The peroneus longus tendon has emerged as a promising alternative, but literature on its functional outcomes remains limited. The objective is to evaluate the functional outcomes of primary ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 31 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft at BLDE (Deemed to be University) Shri B. M. Patil Medical College, Hospital & Research Centre from August 2022 to January 2024. Patients were followed up for 12-21 months. Functional outcomes were assessed using Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Return to pre-injury activity levels and complications were also evaluated. Result: The mean Lysholm score improved from 46.41 ± 6.5 preoperatively to 96.61 ± 3.22 at 12 months postoperatively. The mean IKDC score increased from 41.87 ± 6.91 preoperatively to 91.12 ± 6.86 at 12 months postoperatively. Both improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Twenty-eight patients (91%) returned to their pre-injury activity level, with 20 (64.5%) resuming sports activities. Minor complications were observed in 16.2% of cases, with no major complications requiring revision surgery. Conclusion: ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft demonstrates excellent functional outcomes, high rates of return to pre-injury activity levels, and a low complication rate.

In ACL injury, patient develops knee instability and pain. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction(ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. Hamstrings are one of the commonest grafts used for ACL reconstruction. Inadequate graft size, difficulty harvesting, loss of the synergistic muscles for ACL injured knees are some of the common issues associated with hamstrings. We studied the outcome of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon graft as an alternative graft source that obviates the above mentioned disadvantages of commonly used hamstring grafts. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study in 30 patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon autograft. The patients were followed up for 12 months post-operatively. Functional scores were assessed using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Cincinnati Knee Rating System for knee and AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) Ankle-Hindfoot scoring and Visual Analogue Scale - Foot and Ankle (VAS-FA) for ankle. Also power of foot eversion and first ray plantarflexion were tested and recorded clinically by MRC (Medical Research Council) grading. Result: 30 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (23 male and 7 female patients). Follow-up period was 12 months. Mean IKDC score (81.80) and mean Cincinnati score (363.67) showed significant improvement at 12 month post-operative when compared to pre-operative scores which are 39.6 and 145.33 respectively (p value < 0.05). The mean pre and postoperative AOFAS score was 100.00 and 99.67 respectively at 12 month follow-up. The mean pre and postoperative VAS-FA score was 99.27 and 99.23 respectively at 12 month follow up (p value > 0.05). The 12 month postoperative power of eversion and plantarflexion were grade 5 in all patients. Conclusion: Signifanct improvement in knee functional outcome and no significant difference of functional status and muscle power pre operatively and postoperatively were found at the donor site following PLT graft harvest. Also the surgical procedure of graft harvest was simple with early wound healing and no complications postoperatively. Thus we conclude that peroneus longus tendon can be used safely as a graft for ligament reconstruction with no significant donor site morbidities.",2024,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,150-154,,6,6,,Int.

Methods The patient presented with a history of transient visual disturbance in 2019, exhibiting a limited visual field in the left eye. MR brain imaging and EEG showed no abnormalities. In 2021, the patient experienced headaches and swelling of the face and neck. Physical examination revealed dilated collateral circulation vessels on the chest. Angio CT of the head, neck and chest revealed extensive thrombosis of the neck vessels involving both internal, external, subclavian, brachiocephalic veins up to superior vena cava.

They are randomly divided into 2 groups either ACLR plus ALL reconstruction or ACLR combined with LET in a 1:1 ratio. There are multiple graft options for ACL-R, but here for the study, the hamstring autograft is harvested following the traditional technique. The graft is measured and bony tunnels are drilled. An anatomical reconstruction technique is used in all cases. In group A: the surgeon will harvest peroneus longus graft, then sutured to the double bundle hamstring graft. The graft diameters are measured and recorded. The graft is pulled through the femoral tunnel and passed through the tibial tunnel. The single portion of the graft is passed freely through the tibial and femoral tunnels until the quintuple graft portion occupies both tunnels. The graft is then pulled, and an interference screw (Smith \& Nephew Endoscopy) is fixed to the femur. The next step is to fix the inferior end of the quintuple graft to the tibia after pre-tensioning. After tibial fixation, the remaining PL is passed through the subcutaneous and ALL tunnels. The ligament is fixed under traction, mild valgus stress, and 30' of flexion 1.5 cm from the joint line into a midpoint between Gerdy's tubercle and the fibular head. In group B: the surgeon will use a triple STG hamstring (6- strands) tendon graft. The graft diameters are measured and recorded. Then, LET is performed in a standardized fashion as described in the modified Lemaire technique. LET is fixed with interference screws (Smith \& Nephew Endoscopy).

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied.Methods:Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared.Results:The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up.Conclusions:PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level II.

Incidence of ACL ruptures is estimated to range from 38-78 % per 100000 person years. The primary aim of ACL reconstruction is to restore the function of the ACL and native kinematics of the knee. ACL reconstruction restores the stability of the knee joint and protects the menisci and joint surfaces from further damage. The most preferred graft tissues for ACL reconstruction are hamstrings in view of better cosmesis, satisfactory results and to minimize postoperative mobility. However, use of peroneus tendon graft is increasing in view of simplicity of the technique. Peroneus longus graft harvest is possible due to synergistic action of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. Even some studies suggest that peroneus brevis is more effective evertor than peroneus longus, justifying harvest of peroneus longus tendon. Materials & Methods: We have done 26 cases of ACL injuries treated with arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft at GSL medical college between Jan 2020 to Dec 2020. Cases were followed up for a period of 1 year and have been evaluated based on Lysholm, AOFAS and FADI score systems. Results: In our study, all 26 patients have completed follow up for 1 year (19 male, 7 female). At final follow up anterior drawer test showed normal findings in 80percent, while 20 percent of all examined patients had 1+ anterior laxity. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon is a promising autograft for ACL reconstruction with advantage of simplicity of harvesting technique, larger graft diameter, minimal graft complications.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,4755-4759,,1,10,,Eur.

Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women. Methods: From June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals. Results: PT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count. The reference intervals for PT (seconds), APTT (seconds), fibrinogen (mg/dL), in the first trimester were 10.30–12.88, 25.40–35.46, 280.28–559.00, in the second trimester were 9.80–11.66, 24.05–33.23, 347.75–593.35, in the third trimester were 9.60–11.40, 23.40–31.80, 330.28–628.56, respectively. The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (× 109/L), RBC (× 1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (× 109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33–15.24, 3.73–5.32, 10.33–13.95, 32.22–42.29, 169.66–413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99–15.55, 3.33–4.98, 9.71–13.17, 30.26–40.07, 172.34–372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22–14.14, 3.54–4.98, 9.80–13.97, 31.11–42.70, 151.30–417.14, respectively. Conclusions: Most established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.

But there are potential risks and complications associated with its use as a graft. This retrospective study aimed to examine the complications and donor site morbidity following PLT harvesting. Patients and methods: A retrospective review was performed on an institutional digital patient database, and all patients who underwent ligament reconstruction using PLT autograft were identified. Intraoperative, early, and late complications were reviewed using digital patient notes and patients underwent a complete physical examination during their final follow-up. Ankle function was assessed using the AOFAS score, and manual ankle muscle testing was performed on both sides. Sural nerve iatrogenic injury was evaluated with a dermatomal light touch examination. Cosmetic satisfaction due to incision scar and footwear complaints were also assessed. Results: 82 patients (74 male, eight female) with a mean age of 31.9 ± 10.4 years (range, 16–66) were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up time was 46.6 ± 30.3 months (range, 6–109). The mean AOFAS score for the donor side was 98.7 ± 3.3 (range, 87–100), and the contralateral side score was 100, with manual muscle testing graded as 5 in all movements and similar to the contralateral side. Fifteen patients (18.3%) had hypoesthesia over the dorsolateral aspect of the foot distal to the incision scar, two patients (2.4%) had hyperalgesia over the distal incision scar, and one patient (1.2%) had mild ankle instability. There were two cases (2.4%) of compartment syndrome, both of which were treated with fasciotomy and had complete regression of symptoms after 5 days. One patient (1.2%) had a transient peroneal nerve injury and foot drop that resolved in the sixth month. Conclusions: The results of this retrospective study suggest that harvesting the PLT is associated with a high rate of complications and donor site morbidity. The most common complication was hypoesthesia around the lateral side of the foot, although the ankle functions were not affected significantly. Two cases of compartment syndrome and one transient peroneal nerve injury were observed. Care should be taken while harvesting PLT autograft, and it should be kept in mind that peroneal nerve injury might occur.

Previous literature found individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) experience altered reflex patterns compared to healthy controls. Considering CAI is characterized by intermittent feelings of ankle instability, researchers have speculated that these alterations are related to perceived instability. Our purpose was to determine whether variability and magnitude of cutaneous reflex amplitudes can predict perceived instability levels following sural nerve stimulation during gait. Forty subjects walked while receiving random stimulations and reported their perceived instability. Middle latency reflexes among lower leg muscles were calculated using data derived from surface electromyography. Hierarchical logistical regressions revealed a positive relationship between reflex variability of the peroneus longus and lateral gastrocnemius muscles and perceived instability during midstance. This suggests subjects with consistent reflexes following sural nerve stimulation develop a certain level of perceptual expectation resulting in generally lower feelings of ankle instability, while subjects with more variable motor outputs perceive greater instability at the supraspinal level. Cutaneous reflex variability during stance may be an important objective outcome measure to monitor neuromuscular recovery throughout a rehabilitation or as a potential predictor of future lateral ankle sprains.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,22,11,,Physiol.

3BQA7TMP,journalArticle,2023,,Role of Sensory Deficits and the Effect of Sensory Stimulation on Sensorimotor Control and Neuromuscular Performance in Athletes With Chronic Ankle Instability,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06118879&from=export,"Brief Summary Purpose: Chronic ankle instability (CAI), characterized by instances of repetitive sprains and giving way, is a common chronic dysfunction among athletes. Despite well documented evidence showing impaired peripheral sensory and both central and peripheral motor control, little was known regarding how CAI affects somatosensory cortical activation. Traditionally, management of CAI mostly focused on restoration of motor deficits, with less emphasis on sensory pathway deficits. Only few sensory targeted intervention methods including joint mobilization and massage, have been described. However, methods such as joint mobilization provide not only sensory stimulation but also mechanical alignment correction. In addition, these studies showed functional improvement without exploring mechanisms. Therefore we would like to apply for a three year study grant to firstly investigate the effect of CAI on peripheral and central somatosensation and neuromuscular performance; and secondly to examine the immediate effect of sensory-level electrical stimulation on neurophysiological variables and neuromuscular performance; and lastly to determine the short-term effect of intervention (sensory stimulation with exercise, sham stimulation with exercise, and exercise alone) in athletes with CAI. Research design and methods: This is a cross-sectional exploratory and randomized controlled study. For the first year, we plan to recruit 45 young athletes (20-40 years old) with CAI and 15 matched controls to compare the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), corticomuscular coherence (CMC), α- band event-related desynchronization (ERD), proprioception, two point discrimination threshold of the plantar surfaces, muscle activation and reaching distances of the Y balance test. Activity in the sensorimotor cortex will be recorded using a 64-chanel EEG (SAGA 32/64+ for EEG). Muscle activation is measured using an 8-channel electromyography (EMG) system (Noraxon myo METRICS Portable Lab, Noraxon U.S.A.). For the second year, the 45 young adults with CAI will be randomized into the sensory stimulation (TENS) group, the sham stimulation group, or the control group. The TENS group will receive 40 minutes of sensory electrical stimulation, and the sham group will receive 30 seconds of sensory stimulation at the beginning and end of the treatment. The control group will rest for 40 minutes. The assessment items are identical to those in the first year, and will be carried out before and immediately after the intervention. For the third year, the 45 young adults with CAI will be randomized into the exercise with sensory stimulation (EX-TENS) group, exercise with sham stimulation (EX-ss) group, or exercise alone (EX) group. Participants will receive five sessions of intervention (30 minutes neuromuscular training with or without 40 min stimulation) within two weeks and the assessment will be carried out before and after the intervention. Data analysis: Comparisons of all continuous variables are performed using oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA), and repeated measures ANOVA. The significance level is set at 0.05. Significance. Results of this study provide a better understanding for central somatosensory control mechanisms for chronic ankle instability, and help clinicians and trainers to choose the most appropriate training strategy for people with unstable ankles. We plan to present our work in 3-4 international conferences, and publish 2-3 papers in SCI journals in 5 years. Detailed Description Characteristics of the chronic ankle instability (CAI): Lateral ankle sprain is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries in the sports clinics. The high prevalence of lateral ankle sprains, combined with a high recurrence rate and persistent post sprain symptoms make lateral ankle sprains and their sequelae a significant health impact and healthcare burden. Although lateral ankle sprains are generally considered benign injuries, it is estimated that 40% of individuals with lateral ankle sprains will subsequently develop chronic ankle instability within the first year after a lateral ankle sprain. Chronic ankle instability is characterized by repetitive sprains, perceived instability, and giving way, which can be classified into two categories: mechanical and functional ankle instability. Mechanical instability of the ankle is a result of loss of mechanical structural constraints (i.e., ligaments); whereas functional instability refers to instability related to altered postural control and reduced functional capacity due to impaired sensorimotor control including altered muscle recruitment around the ankle and impairment of the proprioceptive system etc.. In addition to interfering with sporting performance, and CAI has been found to be associated with lower quality of life and increased likelihood (68%-75%) of developing ankle arthritis. Hertel reported that individuals with ankle instability had higher risk of recurrent ankle sprains, and the treatment for symptoms of CAI could be time-consuming and costly. Numerous impairments have been reported associated with CAI, ranging from loss of joint mobility and muscle strength, compromised proprioception and sensation, poor postural control and neuromuscular performance, and altered movement patterns. However, the mechanisms and management strategies are still not clearly understood in many aspects. And thus, a great variety of intervention has been proposed with inconsistent results reported. Conceptual model for the development of CAI: The theory linking poor neuromuscular control and CAI has been discussed for more than half a century. It was believed that after the ankle sprain, some of the joint receptors and peripheral nerve fibers around the ankle joint were affected, resulting in impaired reflex responses and functional stability of the ankle. More researchers later reported that CAI not only presented with sensory deficits, but also deficits in motor control, and these changes in sensorimotor system would eventually lead to loss of function. In 2019, Hertel et al. (2019) revised the current model for the development of CAI. It is proposed that the initial ankle injury would influence the neural system, disturbing the balance and stability between the sensation, perception and motor function. These disturbances would lead to self-adjustment of the sensorimotor system to attempt to adapt to the altered condition, and consequently might result in long term changes in neural network, and expose individuals to persistent symptoms of instability. This newly revised model integrates both peripheral and central sensorimotor systems to explain the development of CAI; but it clearly shows that the central sensorimotor processing in individuals with CAI is less explored, particularly for the impact of CAI on the somatosensory cortex. Individuals with CAI have poorer neuromuscular performance: The effect of CAI on the neuromuscular control and posture stability has been extensively studied. The research topics of interest included altered reflexes and neuromuscular inhibition, muscle activation patterns (timing, recruitment order, and amplitude) and joint mechanics of the lower extremity segments during sudden inversion perturbation or jump landing, and posture control characteristics during balance testing tasks. It is generally agreed that people with CAI had lower Hmax/Mmax ratios (H reflex/M reflex ratios) of the soleus and peroneus longus muscle than those un-injured controls, indicating that neural excitability of the spinal level in those with CAI was depressed; this population also presented with altered muscle activation of the peroneus, tibialis anterior and soleus muscles, and changed balance control strategies. Recent publications of systematic review and meta-analysis by Hoch and McKeon (2014) and by Thompson et al. (2018) showed that there was a strong evidence to support dynamic balance, peroneal reaction, and eversion strength deficits contributing to CAI. Because of the strong evidence showing motor impairment in CAI, the dominant intervention strategy for this population has been motor performance driven so far. Deficits in somatosensation in people with CAI Proprioceptive deficits in CAI have been the main focus of research for decades. Thompsons et al. (2018) indicated that there was moderate evidence supporting both active and passive proprioception deficits in CAI as compared with controls. According to the latest systematic review and meta-analysis by Xue et al. (2021), CAI-affected ankles had poorer ankle kinesthesia in both inversion and plantarflexion when compared with the contralateral side; and individuals with CAI showed kinesthesia defects and active joint reposition deficits in the frontal plane movement (both inversion and eversion) when compared to the healthy controls. Not until recent years that more attention has been drawn to deficits in cutaneous sensation. Hoch et al. (2012) found that the plantar surface was less sensitive to vibratory tactile stimulation as compared to non-CAI people at the head of the first metatarsal, the base of the fifth metatarsal, and the heel, along the innervation of the branches of the sural and tibial nerves. Burcal and Wikstrom found similar results that people with CAI displayed higher Semmes Weinstein monofilament thresholds at the head of the first metatarsal, base of the fifth metatarsal, and sinus tarsi31. The possible involvement of impaired cutaneous sensation in CAI have led to the recent approach of sensory-targeted intervention in this population. Deficits in central sensorimotor control in CAI: As described in the previous paragraphs that the classic theory behind the ankle instability has been based on damages of joint receptors and peripheral nerve fibers. However, emerging data has shown that proprioceptive sensory deficits were not enough to explain the neuromuscular deficits in people with CAI, and that more research is needed to determine how CAI influences central sensorimotor control. Previous studies have shown that in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal dysfunction such as shoulder impingement and low back pain, the integration of corticospinal pathways may be affected, presented as higher active motor threshold, longer cortical silent period, reduced cortical mapping area and shifted center of gravity of the cortical mapping area. Possible impairment of the corticospinal control in CAI has recently been examined in a few studies. While Pietrosimone and Gribble (2012), Shih et al. (2017), and Terada et al. (2022) reported that muscles around the ankle joint had impaired corticospinal excitability (reduced motor-evoked potential of the peroneus longus and soleus muscles), the two systemic reviews with meta analysis did not support these findings and showed that people with or without CAI had similar supraspinal neural excitability. These inconsistencies might be related to the differences in study design, such as testing positions and tasks. The role of altered central motor system excitability in CAI has yet to reach agreement; and little was known about the effect of CAI on the somatosensory cortex. Common outcome measures to evaluate somatosensory cortical activation use electroencephalography (EEG) to detect electrophysiological signals of excitatory and inhibitory action potentials in various areas of the cortex. Previous studies reported abnormalities of P27 potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) in people with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficits, indicating somatosensory cortex neuroplasticity following ACL injuries. Only one study has evaluated the somatosensory cortical activation in people with ankle instability, and found no difference in somatosensory cortical activity (event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the upper alpha frequency) between healthy controls and individuals with unstable ankles. With strong evidence showing connections between central sensorimotor deficits and chronic musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain and ACL deficits, we believe that future research is required to understand the role of sensory deficits, particularly the central somatosensory activation in people with CAI and to provide further explanation for the neurophysiological mechanisms for ankle instability. Restoration of motor performance has been the popular intervention for CAI: From the above review, it is obvious that problems behind chronic ankle instability relate to both sensory and motor systems. However, the majorities of intervention strategies have focused on restoring the defects in motor pathways, including muscle strengthening, neuromuscular training, posture and balance control training. Although many of the studies found positive effects of these motor restoration interventions, the synthesis of evidence only supported partially (limited to moderate level) for the effectiveness of neuromuscular or balance training on muscle performance, postural stability or self-perceived improvement. Emerging evidence showing effectiveness of sensory-orientated intervention for CAI: With more understanding on the involvement of sensory deficits in CAI, some researchers started to describe intervention methods using primarily sensory inputs, such as planar massage, and joint mobilization. Joint mobilization was found to improve dynamic posture performance including landing kinematics, reaching distances of the Y balance test, ankle mobility, and self-perceived dysfunction questionnaires. Although joint mobilization was proposed to have the effect of ""resetting the sensorimotor control"", the spinal-reflex and corticospinal excitability of the soleus and peroneus longus were not altered after one session of joint mobilization. In addition, joint mobilization not only provides sensory stimulation but also offers alignment correction for people with CAI. The effectiveness of joint mobilization could have come from improvement in ankle mobility rather than sensory intervention. Several studies have investigated the effect of pure sensory inputs, the plantar massage, in people with CAI and found that plantar massage effectively improved static postural control. However, these studies only measured perceived dysfunction, or functional performance. No neurophysiological mechanism of sensory intervention in CAI has been explored before. Electrical stimulation as a form of treatment for CAI: Traditionally, neuromuscular stimulation has been used as a form of treatment for various conditions, from peripheral nerve injuries, conditions involving arthrogenic inhibition such as ACL insufficiency or patellofemoral pain, to neurological conditions including stroke or spinal cord injury. A great body of evidence has shown that neuromuscular stimulation is effective in restoring motor functions in these conditions. Another approach of electrical stimulation is to use sensory level of stimulation in attempt to improve sensorimotor control. The rationale is that somatosensory stimulation would enhance cortical plasticity in people post stroke. Pan et al. recruited 12 patients post stroke and assessed the effect of 40 minutes of sensory electrical stimulation, combined with hand rehabilitation program. The changes in sensorimotor control were evaluated using corticomuscular coherence (CMC). After 4 weeks of treatment, the CMC value of the electrical stimulation group is higher than that of the control group, indicating that the cerebral motor cortex and the corresponding muscles have a greater and physiologically meaningful functional connection. Although people with CAI has been found to have benefited from sensory intervention such as plantar massage, no neurophysiological mechanism has been studied. In addition, application of sensory transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) is a relatively risk-free and easy-to-implement modality for rehabilitation. However, no study has investigated the effect and treatment mechanisms of TENS in people with CAI. Research gap and contribution of the study: Current research evidence supported that people with chronic ankle instability have deficits in peripheral sensorimotor systems and central motor impairments, resulting in defects in sensorimotor control and functional performance. However, little was known about how CAI affects the somatosensory cortical activation. The effects of strength training, neuromuscular control training, posture/balance training has been widely investigated for CAI, and positive effects on neuromuscular control, corticospinal excitability, and functional performance have been found for this group of people. Recently, sensory intervention for CAI has been proposed and its treatment effect on static and dynamic posture control as well as functions were reported. Based on the effectiveness of sensory intervention and posture adaptation strategies shown in individuals with CAI, it is reasonable to speculate that central somatosensory processing might have a role in altered neuromuscular performance and recovery (sensory intervention effect) of CAI. However, these neurophysiological mechanisms have never been studied before. To address the above issues, we would like to apply for a three-year grant to firstly investigate the effect of CAI on somatosensory cortical activation, corticomuscular coherence, proprioception, cutaneous sensation of the plantar surfaces, and neuromuscular performance. These variables will be compared between 45 young active adults with CAI and 15 controls for the first year study. Secondly, those with CAI will be randomized into three groups, the sensory stimulation group, the sham stimulation group, and the control group. The participants will receive 40 minutes of sensory level of electrical stimulation or sham stimulation or nothing, and the immediate effect will be examined to understand the effect of sensory-level stimulation on neurophysiological mechanisms and neuromuscular performance. Afterwards, the intervention (sensory stimulation with exercise, sham stimulation with exercise, and exercise alone) will be carried out for 5 sessions in two weeks, and the short term intervention effect of additional sensory stimulation will be assessed.

In this study, the quadruple hamstring tendon (semitendinosus and gracilis) was measured in a sample of Iraqi adult males. The study enrolled 300 Iraqi men who underwent anterior cruciate ligament repair at Diwaniyah Teaching Hospital and Alforat Alawast Private Hospital between January 2020 and December 2021. The repair procedure was based on the utilization of the quadruple (gracilis and semitendinosus) hamstring tendon. The primary outcome measure was the size of the tendon, determined using a sizing tube calibrated to 0.5 mm. Out of the sample, 80% of patients had a graft diameter of 7.5 mm, while 15% had a graft diameter of 8 mm, and 5% had a diameter of 7 mm. Body mass index was a poor predictor of graft size, whereas patient height was an excellent predictor of graft diameter.

However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1β stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. RESULTS: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study illustrated that the administered Plt-exos could alleviate knee OA by attenuating cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, possibly serving as a novel promising treatment for OA in the future.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,2975-2985,,11,51,,Am J Sports Med,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03635465231188122,,aged; animal; articular cartilage; chondrocyte; chondropathy; exosome; human; knee osteoarthritis; metabolism; micro-computed tomography; mouse; pathology; thrombocyte,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed Description Using a Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as an autograft is a common procedure and has been used previously for deltoid ligament reconstruction in flatfoot deformity correction . Recently, (PLT) is gaining popularity as a graft option in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgeries with biomechanical studies showing tensile strength and clinical outcomes comparable to quadrupled hamstring grafts. In addition to using PLT for isolated (ACL), it is also used in posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction, medial collateral ligament reconstruction, posterolateral corner reconstruction of the knee, or knee multiple ligament injuries . The partial-thickness of the tendon has been used variably in knee ligament surgery.. Being a powerful muscle in plantar flexion and eversion of the foot, there might be associated ankle functional impairment.

The hypothesis was that US can accurately predict the diameter of 2PLT autografts during operation. METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent ligament reconstruction with 2PLT autografts were included. Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 cm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5 mm. RESULTS: CSA at 1 cm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6 + 0.2 × [sonographic CSA of PLT at 1 cm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6 + 0.5 × Calf length. CONCLUSION: The diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.IV.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,3362-3368,,8,31,,Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-023-07406-y,,anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; autotransplantation; human; patellar ligament; tendon; transplantation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, clinical data on graft size are limited. PURPOSE: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 ± 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 ± 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 ± 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 ± 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). CONCLUSION: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length.

The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P <.001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy.

This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. Materials and methods: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three-and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. Results: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. Conclusion: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,133-141,,1,17,,Malays. Orthop.

Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. RESULTS: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (β = 15.45 mm2; Šidák adjusted P < .0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (β = -17.20 N per year; adjusted P = .0253), and increased CSA (β = 1.92 mm2 per inch; adjusted P < .0001) and maximum load (β = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P < .0001) with each inch of increased height. CONCLUSION: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely.

The right choice of graft will determine the success of the surgery. For professional athletes, the primary choice remains the bone patellar tendon graft. However, sometimes there are complaints of anterior knee pain. The patellar tendon bone remains the strongest graft source for ACL reconstruction. Currently, the most popular graft used is the hamstring tendon, which consists of the semitendinosus and gracillis. The small incision makes this tendon very popular in reconstructive surgery. However, it is not uncommon for the acquired hamstring tendon size to be unpredictable and sometimes too small. The quadriceps tendon is also a good tendon of choice in the ACL reconstruction surgery. Several studies have shown the results of reconstruction with a balanced force with the patellar tendon bone. The portion of bone obtained from the superior pole of the patella, allows bone-to-bone healing. Currently, several surgeons use the peroneus longus tendon as an alternative graft option in ACL reconstructive surgery. The small incision and the relatively easy process of taking the graft, make more and more surgeons interested in using it. However, the use of the peroneus tendon should be reserved in cases of multiple ligament injury or revision cases. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects on the involved ankle. In many countries, allografts can also be used for ACL reconstruction surgery. Its preparation requires strict conditions, so that the graft condition remains good when used.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,2,11,,Orthop. J.

ACL reconstruction is the current gold standard to restore functional of the knee. Graft selection is important for satisfactory outcomes. Currently, most used autograft are hamstring tendon (HT) and bone patellar tendon bone (BPTB) grafts. This study aims to thoroughly evaluate and review an alternative autograft for ACL reconstruction, which is peroneus longus tendon (PLT). Method: Systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. Literature was searched through PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library using Boolean operators. This study included original articles reporting on (1) clinical studies of ACL reconstruction (single-bundle or double-bundle) using PLT autograft (anterior-half, posterior half, or full-thickness); and (2) studies directly comparing outcomes of PLT versus HT. All procedures were primary ligament reconstructions performed for symptomatic acute or chronic ACL injury, with or without meniscal injury. The outcomes assessed included clinical and functional outcome, namely IKDC score, AOFAS scale and FADI. Results: From 247 studies obtained, after full-text review, 4 studies met all eligibility criteria. A total of 259 patients were included in this study. No significant differences was found in IKDC score (p = 0.99) and FADI score (p = 0.11) but significant differences was found in the mean of AOFAS score in favor of HT autograft (p = 0.03). Conclusion: PLT autograft is a suitable alternative graft choice from the others for the knee of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,2,11,,Orthop. J.

Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. Methods: This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. Results: Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22–31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5–8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p = < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients.

Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19±8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values.

Knee stability is mainly provided by ligaments and involves the cruciate ligaments. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament are the most important ones. ACL plays an important role in stabilizing knee joints against translational and rotational forces. ACL tear may lead to knee instability, meniscus tear, and subsequent osteoarthritis. Materials and Methods: All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL tear were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups. Result: Patient was followed at 6 weeks, 3 and 6-months post operatively for clinical and radiological evaluation and results at end of 6 months were calculated by using IKDC and Lysholm knee score. The functional and radiological outcome is similar in both groups. In our study, 50 patients of ACL injury were operated. There were 25 (50%) patients in Group H (Hamstring tendon graft) and 25 (50%) patients in Group P (Peroneus Longus tendon graft). The mean age of patients in Group-H was 35.15 ± 11.19 years (range 20-54 years) and in Group-P, it was 33.95 ± 8.99 years (range 19-42 years). In both groups, males predominated in terms of gender (72% in group H and 80% in group P). In Group-H, most of the patients had left side involvement and in Group-P, most of the patients had right side involvement. The mean height in Group-H was 169.00 ± 9.07 cm and in Group-P, it was 168.99 ± 7.58 cm. The mean weight in Group-H was 65.45 ± 8.60 kg and in Group-P, it was 67.29 ± 8.38 kg. In both groups, majority of patients sustained injury due to road traffic accident, and sports related injuries were relatively less in our study. The average graft diameter of Group H was 10.5 ± 0.52 mm and that of Group P was 10.6 ± 0.39 mm. Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.",2023,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,2346-2351,,3,13,,Eur. J. Cardiovasc.

Some studies have reported that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has sufficient length and strength. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the PLT can be used as a novel appropriate material for PCL reconstruction therapy. Materials and methods: Herein, we systematically analysed the clinical effect of the double-stranded PLT and the four-stranded hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the PCL and compared the effectiveness and safety of these two surgical approaches in the reconstruction of PCL injury. A total of 48 patients with complete rupture of the PCL were divided into Group A (reconstructed with the double-stranded PLT, 25 cases) and Group B (reconstructed with the four-stranded hamstring tendon, 23 cases). Results: The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The intraoperative time for tendon extraction was significantly shorter in Group A than Group B. Twenty-four months after operation, patients in the two groups showed the alleviated tibial posterior displacement and the increased IKDC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score. Nevertheless, these scores showed no significant differences between the two groups. Additionally, compared with the therapy using the four-stranded hamstring tendon, therapy using the double-stranded PLT is simpler and safer. Discussion: Both surgical methods are effective in the treatment of PCL injury. The PLT could be a good choice for PCL injury reconstruction material, especially when the four-stranded hamstring tendon is accidentally damaged or ineffective. Our study may provide guidance for the clinical treatment of PCL injury. Level of Evidence: III, retrospective study.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,8,108,,Orthop. Traumatol.: Surg.

Aims: To track the effect of heparin and CS in neonates weighing <5 kg using VT and SLT. Methods: Neonates weighing <5 kg undergoing CS were included. Samples were obtained at the start of surgery (Basal), before separation from bypass (Bypass) and after heparin reversal (Postprotamine). VT performed by ROTEM delta (Instrumentation Laboratory, IL). SLT: PT% activity (PT%), APTT, thrombin time (TT), antithrombin (AT) and anti-factor Xa activity (AntiXa) by IL reagents in ACL TOP coagulometer. HemoCell CXH800 (Beckman Coulter) for PLT. Cumulative 12 h chest tube drainage (CTD) was assessed for postsurgical bleeding. Results: 32 patients were included. Median (IRQ) age was 19 days (6-25), median weight was 3380 g (3082-3785).

Hamstring tendon (HT) autograft is the most popular graft choice for ACL reconstruction worldwide. Other autografts include bone-patellar tendon-bone and quadriceps tendon, yet no globally accepted gold standard of graft choice exists for use in ACL reconstruction. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been reported as an autograft choice for ligament reconstruction\[2\], but there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes using the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) compared with hamstring tendon autograft. Therefore, we are interested in investigating whether the clinical outcomes of the PLT autograft were equivalent to the Six-strand- hamstring tendon autograft. Detailed Description prospective randomized clinical study to compare the results of all-inside anatomical ACL reconstruction using the AHPLT and using Six-strand- tendon autograft. Randomization will be done with inclusion criteria of primary ACL rupture in adult patients and exclusion criteria of serious osteoarthritis, revision cases, and multiple ligament injuries.

Criteria for use was established to have 4 units of LTOWB as the 1st cycle of the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) for trauma patients that were male or females >50 years old. This would mimic the routine MTP cycle of 4 Red Blood Cells (RBCs), 4 Thawed Plasma (TP) and 1 apheresis platelet (PLT). Originally Leukocyte Reduced (LR) LTOWB was not available so there were concerns about having the whole blood packed into Non-LR RBCs as our general inventory is 100% LR. Initially, the LTOWB was to be discarded if not transfused. LTOWB required an established standing order, which became 4 units delivered every 2 weeks. When reviewing the trial data, the biggest concern was the amount of wastage seen due to discarding the non-LR LTOWB. Study Design/Methods: Routine use of LTOWB was implemented and wastage continued to be monitored. There was an interruption due to a change in blood supplier but now the LTOWB were available as LR, which allowed the possibility of have LR packed RBCs rather than discard of the LTOWB. Data was collected for a year prior to implementing the packing of the WB and then a year post implementation. In addition, the LTOWB standing order was moved from 4 units every 2 weeks to 4 units every week. Results/Findings: A total of 38 LTOWB were discarded prior to implementing the packing of WB due to the units being non-LR. Average unit cost for the non-LR LTOWB was $500 a unit so $19,000 worth of product was discarded. Moving to LR LTOWB and implementing the packing of WB units saved 135 units over 12 months. LR LTOWB average cost was higher at $550 per unit but because the new process allowed RBC units to be used there was a savings of $74,800 for the 12-month period. Conclusion: Two changes helped dramatically decrease the wastage associated with LTOWB. (1) Changing blood suppliers, which allowed LR LTOWB to be received and (2) Implementing the packing of WB to RBCs and recovered plasma. Both changes have allowed us to continue to supply the LTOWB that the trauma team wanted without having excess wastage of an in demand blood product and the associated costs.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,159A-160A,,"(Pelock A.)

Injury of the ALL is commonly associated with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. If left untreated, ALL lesions may lead to residual anterolateral rotational instability of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which is a common cause of anterior cruciate ligament graft failure. The function of the ALL can be restored by lateral extraarticular tenodesis or anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR). In the lateral extraarticular tenodesis procedure, a strip of the iliotibial band is placed in a non-anatomical position to restrain the internal rotation of the tibia, while in ALLR, a free graft is fixed at the insertion points of the native ALL. Gracilis and semitendinosus grafts have mainly been utilized for ALLR, but other autografts have also been suggested. Furthermore, allografts and synthetic grafts have been applied to minimize donor-site morbidity and maximize the size and strength of the graft. Nevertheless, there has been no strong evidence to fully support one method over another thus far.

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. Results: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24–31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P<0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. Conclusion: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients.

ACL injuries are frequently associated with damage of other structures within the knee, such as the meniscus. The meniscus is an important structure that provides protection for articular cartilage and stabilization of the joint. Long-term studies of PTOA after ACLR mainly used radiographs. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used in a limited number of studies to evaluate structural damages, but this only provides information on morphologic changes that occur at relatively late stages of the disease. In this study, we aim to use quantitative MRI (qMRI) to evaluate cartilage and meniscus degeneration in patients at 10 years after ACLR. Methods: This is a multi-site multi-vendor study that involves three sites and two MR platforms (Siemens 3T and Philips 3T). MRI protocols have been harmonized between sites and cross validation data were collected using phantoms. The patients are from a nested cohort within Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Onsite Cohort at 10 years after ACLR. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were: 22-50 years old; ACL tear during a sport; no previous knee injury; no graft rupture during follow-up. In this preliminary report, 51 patients (age 32.8 ± 6.4 years; 25 females; body mass index [BMI] 25.7 ± 5.7 kg/m2; 40 hamstring autograft, 9 bone-patellar tendonbone autograft, and 2 allograft) and 17 healthy control participants (age 30.8 ± 7.8 years; 10 females; BMI 23.8 ± 5.6 kg/m2) were studied. The MRI protocol included high-resolution Dual-Echo Steady State (DESS), and combined gradient echo MAPSS T1ρ and T2 mapping. Cartilage and meniscus were automatically segmented on DESS images using an in-house developed deeplearning model into medial/lateral femoral condyle (MFC/LFC), medial/lateral tibia (MT/LT), trochlear (TRO), and patellar cartilage (PAT), and medial and lateral menisci (MM/LM). Each cartilage compartment was further divided into sub-regions based on a modified MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) definition: central and posterior for MFC/LMC (cMFC/cLMC, pMFC/pLMC); anterior, central, and posterior for MT/LT (aMT/aLT, cMT/cLT, pMT/pLT); medial, central, and lateral for PAT/TRO (mPAT/mTRO, cPAT/cTRO, lPAT/lTRO). Menisci were further divided into anterior horn (aMM, aLM), central (body) (cMM, cLM), and posterior horn (pMM, pLM) subregions. These cartilage and menisci subregions were then transformed and overlaid onto the T1ρ and T2 parameter maps after co-registering the DESS image to the first echo of the 3D MAPSS sequence using the Elastix toolbox. T1ρ and T2 parameter maps were obtained by a voxel-wise two-parameter monoexponential fitting. The mean and standard deviation for each subregion was recorded and compared between three knee groups: operated and contralateral knees from patients, and control knees from healthy controls, using a mixed-effects regression model, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Results: For cartilage, compared to contralateral knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1ρ and T2 values in MFC, MT, and TRO compartments. Looking into subcompartments, for MFC, MT, and TRO, most of the subcompartments (cMFC, pMFC; cMT, pMT; mTRO, cTRO) showed significantly higher T1ρ and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For LFC and LT, only the posterior subcompartments showed significantly higher T1ρ and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For PAT, no significant differences were observed between operated and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1ρ and T2 values in all the six compartments. Besides, contralateral knees also showed higher T1ρ and T2 values in LFC, LT and PAT compartments compared to healthy control knees (Figure 1 for T1ρ, T2 with similar trend was not shown). For meniscus, no significant differences in T1ρ and T2 values were observed between injured and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, both operated and contralateral knees in patients had significantly higher T1ρ values in LM and significantly higher T2 values in MM (Figure 2). Conclusions: Cartilage T1ρ and T2 values were higher in operated knees compared to contralateral knees at 10 years after ACLR, except for patellar compartment. In patellar cartilage, no significant differences were observed between sides in patients, but both sides were significantly higher than control knees. Our data showed that contralateral knees after ACLR may not represent 'healthy controls' as there might be compensatory changes and early degeneration in contralateral knees as a result of injury and surgery to their other knee. Although we observed this general trend of higher cartilage T1ρ and T2 values in the operated knees compared to contralateral knees, no significant differences were observed in meniscus T1ρ and T2 values between sides in patients, suggesting the timing of cartilage and meniscus degeneration may be different for patients after ACLR. Meniscus T1ρ and T2 values in both sides are higher than control knees, suggesting early degeneration in meniscus in patients in both sides. The results will be confirmed with more patient data being collected in the ongoing study. The relationship between qMRI, morphological tissue changes, and patient-reported outcomes after ACLR will also be evaluated in future work.

Reconstruction of this ligament with hamstring tendon has been time-tested but peroneus longus autograft is also gaining popularity. However, very limited literature is available comparing the two grafts. This study aims to compare the functional outcome and donor site morbidity between hamstrings and peroneus longus autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted on 45 patients, who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were assigned into Hamstring group and the Peroneus longus group. Functional outcome was assessed using Lysholm score and Modified Cincinnati scores for the knee joint and American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scoring for ankle joint. Donor site morbidity was assessed by measuring flexion and extension strength of the knee and plantar flexion and eversion strength of the ankle by handheld dynamometer preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and 1 year follow up. Results: Functional outcome of the knee showed significant improvement in peroneus longus group (p-value 0.002) compared to hamstring group. Even though there was minimal reduction in functional outcome of the ankle at 6 months follow-up in peroneus longus group, it improved at one year follow-up. While assessing the donor site morbidity at the knee joint, knee flexion strength showed improvement in the group (p-value 0.02) but reduced in the hamstring group where the hamstring tendon was harvested. Knee extension strength in the hamstring group scored marginally better than the peroneus longus group, which was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,1,29,,J. Orthop. Traum.

Purpose: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20° flexion angle. A standardized 12-N·m varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. Results: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 ± 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 ± 0.6 and 2.2 ± 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P =.387). Conclusion: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries. Clinical Relevance: With the current findings, understanding the effect of ACL and posterolateral corner injuries on lateral gapping under varus stress can aid in correctly diagnosing knee injuries and determining appropriate treatment plans.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,6,10,,Orthop.

The arterial biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard; alongside the classic fnding of transmural infltrate and giant cells, other abnormalities have been described, of which it is not yet known whether they identify specifc clinical subsets. PET is not yet used for diagnosis, but it can be suggestive in patients with high clinical suspect; it may be useful for assessing the extention of the disease in already diagnosed patients and for ruling out alternative diagnoses as infections and neoplasms. More recently, PET has been used to assess disease metabolic activity Objectives: The aim of our study is to evaluate, in patients with histologically confrmed temporal arteritis, correlations between pathological subsets, metabolic activity and different clinical behavior. Methods: We have recovered the medical records of patients with the diagnosis of temporal arteritis made in our Rheumatology service from January 2007 until now. We selected those satisfying the ACR 1990 criteria and, fnally, those with a positive biopsy. We analyzed age at onset of symptoms, diagnostic delay, presence of PMR, fever, constitutional symptoms, headache, temporal artery induration, visual loss; we analyzed CRP, ESR, plasmatic Hb, PLT count, hypoco-mplementemia, ANA, aCL, ANCA. The referring pathologist, who didn't know the history of patients, re-examined all the biopsies performed, focusing on: transmural, periadventitial, limited to small vessels or vasa vasorum infltrate, presence of giant cells, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasmacells, stenosis, thrombosis, fbrinoid necrosis. The nuclear doctor retrieved the PET images by re-assigning each patient the relative PET VAS score. Descriptive analysis was performed: absolute and percentage frequencies were calculated for categorical variables and mean, standard deviation, range and percentiles for quantitative variables. The relationship between variables was tested by the chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney rank test. All analyzes were performed with the STATA software 14.2. Results: We analyzed 46 patients (F 32, M 14), average age at onset of symptoms of 75.5 yrs and average diagnostic delay of 3.2 months. Headache was reported by 37 patients, fever and asthenia by 26 and 24 respectively, jaw claudication and PMR by 18 and 7. 11 patients had visual loss while 4 and 2 respectively reported amaurosis and diplopia. Temporal artery induration was described in 24 patients. Tests of systemic infammation were abnormal (mean CRP 85 mg/L, ESR 72.7 mm/1h); the fnding of hypocomplementemia (1/26 patients), ANA, aCL and ANCA positivity (2/31, 1/27 and 1/25) was negligible. Histological analysis showed the prevalence of transmural infltrate (100% of patients), giant cells (87%) and lymphocytes/macrophages (85% both); small vessel vasculitis (59%) and the presence of plasma cells (53%), neutrophils (48%) and eosino-phils (22%) were less represented. Periadventitial infltrate was described in 29% of patients, with negligibility of vasculitis limited to the adventitia and of the vasa vasorum (2 and 0/46). Intimal hyperplasia and necrosis (22 and 14/46) prevailed over calcifcations, stenosis and thrombosis (7-5-1/46). PET was available in 14 patients including 6 positive (43%), with a median PET VAS score of 7 (range 6-21); 8/13 patients had not taken steroids prior to PET. Conclusion: In our retrospective study we observed, in addition to transmural infltrate and giant cells, the presence of lymphocytes, macrophages and small vessel vasculitis. No correlation was observed between clinical fndings, biological and metabolic activity, apart from the increased presence of giant cells in PET positive patients. Visual loss is slightly more common in PET negative patients. This may be due to severity of the cases which needed early steroid treatment.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,1422-1423,,"(Girelli F.; Bernardi S.; Gardelli L.)

Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, two authors conducted a systematic review exploring the biomechanical properties of ACL graft sources (querying PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases). Using the keywords “anterior cruciate ligament graft,” “biomechanics,” and “biomechanical testing,” relevant articles of any level of evidence were identified as eligible and included if they reported on the biomechanical properties of skeletally immature or mature ACL grafts solely and if the grafts were studied in vitro, in isolation, and under similar testing conditions. Studies were excluded if performed on both skeletally immature and mature or non-human grafts, or if the grafts were tested after fixation in a cadaveric knee. For each graft, failure load, stiffness, Young's modulus, maximum stress, and maximum strain were recorded. Findings: Twenty-six articles were included. Most studies reported equal or increased biomechanical failure load and stiffness of their tested bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring, quadriceps, peroneus longus, tibialis anterior and posterior, Achilles, tensor fascia lata, and iliotibial band grafts compared to the native ACL. All recorded biomechanical properties had similar values between graft types. Interpretation: Most grafts used for ACL reconstruction are biomechanically superior to the native ACL. Utilizing a proper graft, combined with a standard surgical technique and a rigorous rehabilitation before and after surgery, will improve outcomes of ACL reconstruction.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,"(Malige A., Ajith.malige@gmail.com) St. Luke's University Health Network, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, 801 Ostrum Street, Bethlehem, PA, United States",95,,Clin.

The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. Purpose: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-N·m force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P =.863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ± 0.83–cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL–posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ± 1.02–cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ± 1.35–cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P =.154). Conclusion: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height.

Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. Research question: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (n = 27) and ligament dominance (n = 27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (p ≤ 0.05). Results: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (P < 0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. Significance: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,225-229,,"(Saki F., f_saki@basu.ac.ir; Bakhtiari Khou S.)

COVID-19 is characterized by atypical pneumonia, mild colds, and more severe illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory distress, thrombosis, organ failure, and various secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Notably, the severity of COVID-19 in different age groups is not well known, and the validity of clinical laboratory data remains unclear. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we examined differential regulation of clinical, hematologic, and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. We divided 104 COVID-19 patients into five different groups according to age (0−17, 18−45, 46−65, 66−79, and >80 years). Baseline data (sex, comorbidities, intensive care admission, and medications), hematologic markers, liver, and renal function tests, coagulation, and inflammatory markers were examined in these groups. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal threshold for predicting COVID-19 biological markers. Results: We found that the highest percentage (45%) of COVID-19 patients was in the age group of 46−65 years. The hematologic parameters (WBC, HB, and PLT) were normal between the patient groups. The area under the curve in ROC analysis showed significant differences in the levels of creatine, GGT, BUN, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, AST, and procalcitonin between the patients of age groups 46−65 and 66−79 years. Renal biomarkers were significantly high in most patients, regardless of age. In contrast, the liver biomarkers, did not differ significantly between patient groups. Conclusion: The main finding of our study is that laboratory parameters such as GGT, creatinine, BUN, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin and D-dimer were differentially regulated in COVID -19 patients of different age groups. Importantly, these laboratory parameters may help as clinical predictors to assess the severity of the disease in the population. We conclude here that age is an important factor influencing COVID-19 severity.",2022,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,214-221,,2,15,,J. Infect.

Thirty-five young (16 ± 1 years), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10 s), VIBRATION (20 s) and POST (20 s) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a “rigid” strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a “plastic” strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (p < 0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (p < 0.05). ST activation was higher during POST in the rigid strategy and did not return to the PRE level (p < 0.05) whereas it did in the plastic strategy.

Hamstring autograft harvesting-related factor is one of the suspected causes. A lack of tibiofemoral internal rotation force due to strength deficit causes the patella tends to shift laterally. AIM: Peroneus longus tendon has been proposed as an alternative graft source due to its adequate tensile strength and minimal donor site morbidity to the knee biomechanics, including the patellofemoral joint. This tendon does not cross the knee joint and thus does not affect patellofemoral alignment and biomechanics. This study aims to compare patellofemoral problems between hamstring and peroneus longus autograft harvested patients following ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one subjects who underwent primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction between September 2018 and September 2019 and met the inclusion criteria were grouped into the hamstring group (n = 16) and peroneus longus group (n = 15). Both groups were evaluated retrospectively. The follow-up assessment was conducted on the phase II rehabilitation program. The assessed variables were pain, crepitus, and the Indonesian-validated Kujala score. RESULTS: No significant differences in pain and crepitus were found between both groups. There were significant differences in the Kujala score between both groups (p < 0.001). The peroneus longus group reported an averagely higher score than the hamstring group.

Methods: A total of 33 patients received allografts for reconstructive knee surgery between 2007 and 2017. The follow up evaluation consisted of a clinical knee examination including evaluation of range of motion (ROM), lateral and medial laxity, the Lachman test, the Pivot shift test, the sag test, the posterior drawer test and checking for patellofemoral pain. The following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were used; the Lysholm Function Score, the Tegner activity score, and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Results: Twenty-one (64%) patients were available for the follow-up evaluation and the mean follow-up time was 4.8 years. A total of 16 out of 21 patients had multiligament injuries of which the ACL was the ligament most frequently ruptured. At the time of follow-up, 14 out of 16 patients (87%) with ACL injury had Lachman test grade 0 or grade 1 + , and 12 out of 13 (92%) had a pivot shift grade 0 or 1 +. The mean Lysholm Score was 74. All mean KOOS subscale values were ≥ 59 at the follow-up. The preoperative Tegner activity score was 3 (range, 1–6) and 4 (range, 2–6) at follow up. There were no deep postoperative infections. A total of 19 out of 21 patients (90%) reported that they would have undergone surgery again had they known the clinical outcome in advance. Conclusions: The patients improved from the preoperative score to the follow-up score in the knee-related Quality of Life (QoL) KOOS subscale.

A 51 year-old man, smoker, presented to our ER with chest pain. EKG showed Q waves and STE in the anterior leads, with increased troponin levels. A diagnosis of anterior STEMI was made and he was taken into our catheterization laboratory, where a high burden thrombotic plaque determining LM and ostial LAD subocclusion was treated with PPCI and a DES implantation; in addition, multiple failed PCI attempts were performed on a distal LAD occlusion, and an integrilin bolus was administered. The patient was admitted to our CICU and a DAPT with ASA and Ticagrelor was started. TTE showed LVEF 40%, apical akinesis, septal and anterior hypokinesis, and no significant valve disease. An aPTT abnormal value (100.5 s; reference range 25-38.5 s) was detected, not corrected by aPTT mixing study. Given suspected autoimmune prothrombotic state, normal Hb and PLT values and low bleeding risk, LMWH 100 IU/kg every 12 h was started, in addition to DAPT with switch from Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel. LA and aCL and anti-β2GPI IgG were positive, with negativity of others rheumatologic tests, confirming primary APS diagnosis. Repeat TTE showed EF 50%. The patient was discharged in 'triple therapy' (DAPT plus LMWH), and referred to the rheumatology clinic. LA, aCL, and anti-β2GPI tests 12 weeks later were positive, confirming a triple positive APS and satisfying revised Sapporo criteria. The rheumatologist switched therapy to Clopidogrel plus Warfarin. At 3 months follow-up, the patient, former smoker, was asymptomatic and TTE confirmed EF 50%, so he was recommended to continue with his medical therapy. APS is rarely associated with AMI (∼5.5%) and in only 2.8% cases AMI represents the onset of the disease. AMI pathogenesis in APS is considered to be acute thrombosis of coronary arteries, in contrast with atherosclerotic plaque rupture in typical AMI. Key discriminators to identify APS as potential underlying cause of AMI include young age, previous unprovoked thromboses, low platelets count (they are consumed in the thrombotic process), high aPTT value (LA may interfere with assembly of the prothrombinase complex on phospholipids), coronary artery thromboses in the setting of otherwise normal otherwise appearing coronary arteries. APS antibodies have also pro-inflammatory activity on vascular endothelial cells, leading to accelerated atherosclerosis. aGAPSS score (high risk ≥10) is useful for risk stratification of recurrent thrombosis and AMI in young patients with APS. The treatment of AMI in APS is therefore a clinical challenge. Strict management of additional CV risk factors is crucial. VKA (INR >3 with Warfarin, INR2-3 with Warfarin and ASA) should be provided for life, because of the very high risk of recurrent TE. DOACs are less effective and less safe than VKAs for TE prevention in APS. The role of coronary stents, considering higher rates of stent thrombosis after PCI in APS patients triple therapy concomitant risks, requires further studies. Due to lack of large, randomized, prospective studies, there is no clear experts consensus about optimal antithrombotic therapy in secondary prevention after arterial TE. APS patients with STEMI should undergo PCI, usually associated with thrombus aspiration, and in selected cases DES implantation in culprit lesion followed by triple antithrombotic therapy with short-term DAPT and long-term VKA.",2021,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,G146,,SUPPL G,23,,Eur.

Furthermore, significant improvements in clinical functional outcome and stability of the injured knee makes PLT a suitable graft for PCL in simultaneous ACL-PCL arthroscopic reconstruction. Data Background Recent comparative studies suggest that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) may be a good alternative autograft in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in terms of strength, efficacy, and safety. However, the presence of several donor ankle morbidities observed postoperatively suggests a possible gap in the operative technique described in current literature. The aim of this study is to describe a surgical technique in harvesting the PLT for arthroscopic reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in patients with combined ACL-PCL tears, thereby decreasing, if not eliminating, the postoperative outcome of donor ankle weakness. Methods In this case series, four patients diagnosed with combined ACL-PCL tears undergo simultaneous arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL and PCL using the ipsilateral hamstring and peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as autografts respectively. After harvesting the PLT, the remaining distal stump of the tendon was sutured on to the peroneus brevis using simple interrupted technique. Functional Foot Index (FFI) was utilised to measure clinical functional outcome of the donor ankle, whereas Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was utilized to measure clinical functional outcome of the injured knee. Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) was used to document motor strength of the donor ankle, and special tests of the knee were performed to assess stability of the injured knee. Results With the longest follow-up period of 3 years, significant and continuous improvements were noted in clinical functional outcomes of the donor ankle and injured knee in all patients who underwent the surgical procedure. Physical examination findings reveal no weakness in first ray plantarflexion and foot eversion of the donor ankle as early as 3 months in the postoperative period. Previously positive findings in the special tests performed on the knee, suggesting the presence of a multi-ligamentous injury, reveal negative findings immediately intraoperatively, as soon as the autografts are secured. Conclusion Suturing the distal stump of the remaining PLT to peroneus brevis is a novel and crucial step in preventing donor ankle morbidity after harvesting the PLT for PCL reconstruction in combined ACL-PCL tears. Significant improvements in clinical functional outcome, and preservation of preoperative motor strength of the donor ankle suggest that donor ankle morbidity is prevented.

The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery. Classical mechanical tests have been performed with various types of tendons, however, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus tend to suffer the least biomechanical changes after irradiation. Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21 kGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21 kGy) and storage times (5 and 6 months) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading. Static creep tests were performed with 250 N load during 60 s. Deformation at the end of the loading phase of both tendons was significantly smaller after 5 months long storage than that after 6 months long storage. TE5 showed significantly less creep than group TE6, and TE6 significantly greater than PE6. The creep of TE5 was significantly lower than that of TG5.

METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid (MEDICINE), and EMBASE databases were queried for original articles from clinical studies including the keywords: ACL reconstruction and PLT autograft. Studies comparing PLT autograft versus HT autograft were included in this analysis and the following data were extracted from studies meeting the inclusion criteria: graft diameter, functional outcomes (Tegner activity scale, Lysholm score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score), knee laxity (Lachman test), and complications (donor site pain or paresthesia, graft failure). Besides, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) pre-operation and at last follow-up were also compared among patients using PLT autograft. Meta-analysis was applied using Review Manager 5.3 and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies including 925 patients with ACL reconstruction met inclusion criteria. Of these, 5 studies included a direct comparison of PLT autograft (164 patients) versus HT autograft (174 patients). No significant difference was observed between PLT and HT autografts for Tegner activity scale, Lachman test, donor site pain, or graft failure. However, PLT groups demonstrated better Lysholm score (mean difference between PLT and HT groups, 1.55; 95% CI 0.20-2.89; p = 0.02) and IKDC subjective score (mean difference between PLT and HT groups, 3.24; 95% CI 0.29-6.19; p = 0.03). No difference of FADI was found (n.s.) but AOFAS was slightly decreased at last post-operative follow-up for patients with PLT autograft compared with pre-operative scores (mean difference of 0.31, 95% CI 0.07-0.54, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: PLT autograft demonstrated comparable functional outcomes and graft survival rates compared with HT autograft for ACL reconstruction. However, a slight decrease in AOFAS score should be considered during surgical planning. Hence, the PLT is a suitable autograft harvested outside the knee for ACL reconstruction to avoid the complication of quadriceps-hamstring imbalance which can occur when harvesting autografts from the knee.Level II.",2021,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,2869-2879,,9,29,,Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-06279-9,,anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; autotransplantation; hamstring tendon; human; meta analysis; tendon; treatment outcome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. The choice of graft is principal in providing optimal knee stability after surgery. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is an autograft modality that offers unique benefits for ACL reconstruction cases. Presentation of case: We present a case of ACL reconstruction surgery using PLT graft in a patient with a confirmed ACL rupture. Assessment of post-surgical pain, knee stability, and ankle function were performed to determine functional outcome and donor site morbidity. The follow-up results revealed favorable recovery and improvement in all objective parameters. Discussion: Post-operative biomechanical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score. The use of PLT in ACL reconstruction established an excellent potential for its satisfactory result and comparable to other graft modalities in widely used evidence-based findings.

Methods: A clinical data of 30 patients with PCL injury, who were admitted between December 2015 and September 2018 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon and TightRope technique. Among them, 19 were male and 11 were female, aged 17-48 years (mean, 28.2 years). The PCL injury was caused by traffic accident in 8 cases, sport in 14 cases, falling and bruising by a heavy objective in 5 cases, and other injuries in 3 cases. The interval between injury and operation was 10-90 days (mean, 39.3 days). The PCL injury was rated as grade Ⅱ in 6 cases and grade Ⅲ in 24 cases. The posterior drawer test was positive in 26 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 24 cases. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 61.37±8.49, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was near normal in 2 cases, abnormal in 8 cases, and significantly abnormal in 20 cases. The modified Lysholm knee score was 62.20±5.67. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (101.83±8.15) °. Results: The operative time ranged from 70 to 110 minutes (mean, 79.7 minutes). All incisions healed by first intetion. All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 19.0 months). There were 3 cases of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity after operation, and 1 case of approximately 10° limitation of knee extension. At last follow-up, the posterior drawer test was positive in 2 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 1 case, with significant differences compared with the preoperative period ( χ2=38.571, P=0.000; χ2=36.274, P=0.000). The IKDC score was 84.67±3.67, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was normal in 16 cases, nearly normal in 10 cases, abnormal in 3 cases, and significantly abnormal in 1 case; the modified Lysholm knee score was 90.37±4.49; all of the above indexes were significantly better than preoperative ones, and the differences were significant ( t=-12.387, P=0.000; Z=-2.810, P=0.005; t=-22.865, P=0.000). Knee ROM was (88.33±9.86)° at 1 month after operation and reached (113.33±13.48)° at last follow-up, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05).

Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as an alternative autograft for reconstruction in kneeling populations and in simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries. Objective To evaluate the current evidence on the outcome of primary ACLR with PLT autograft in adults and donor ankle morbidity, in addition to determining the average PLT graft dimensions from published studies. Evidence review Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and Virtual Health Library databases using the terms ""anterior cruciate ligament,""""peroneus longus""and ""fibularis longus""alone and in combination with Boolean operators AND/OR. Studies evaluating clinical and stability outcomes, graft-donor ankle morbidity and graft dimensions of PLT in ACLR were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (mCMS). A narrative analysis is presented using frequency-weighted means wherever feasible. Publication bias was assessed using the ROBIS tool. Findings Twelve articles with intermediate-level methodological quality were included. Eight studies assessing the clinical and stability outcomes of reconstruction with PLT showed satisfactory outcomes, similar to those of hamstring tendons (HT). No studies assessed anterior knee pain as an outcome. Six studies evaluated the graft-donor ankle morbidity using general functional foot and ankle scores and non-validated tools, showing favourable outcomes. Nine studies assessed PLT graft diameter, revealing grafts consistently larger than 7 mm among the different preparation techniques, which is comparable with reports of HT grafts. Conclusions and relevance The clinical and stability outcomes of ACLR with different PLT autograft preparation techniques are comparable with those of HT during short-term follow-up; however, there is insufficient evidence to support its use in the populations that motivated its implementation. Thus, stronger evidence obtained with the use of validated tools reporting negligible donor-graft ankle morbidity after PLT harvesting is required prior to recommending its routine use, despite the consistency of its dimensions.

She was diagnosed with SLE with positive ANA and double stranded DNA. Her hemoglobin was 6.0 gm/dl with positive Coombs and low haptoglobin, her platelet count was 12,000. C3 and C4 were low. She was treated with intravenous 'pulse' methylprednisolone followed by high dose prednisone, azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine with good response. She currently feels well without complaints other than mild morning stiffness in her hands and occasional malar rash. Current medications are azathioprine 125 mg daily, hydroxychloroquine 300 mg daily, and prednisone 5 mg daily. Physical exam at the visit is unremarkable and routine labs including urinalysis are normal. She has been using barrier contraception (condoms) but asks about other options. She is very worried that any hormone therapy will cause her lupus to flare again. How do you assess her, and what do you recommend? a. Serologies show negative anti-dsDNA, normal C3C4, and negative antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) including lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta 2 Glycoprotein I (ab2GPI). b. Serologies show negative anti-dsDNA, normal C3C4, and positive LAC, positive aCL IgG 68 and positive ab2GPI IgG 45 Discussion Point •The best way to assess patients with SLE for safe and effective contraception, in the setting of negative and positive aPL Case 2: 33-year-old seeking assisted reproductive technology A 33-year-old woman with SLE presents for routine followup. You have followed her since her diagnosis at age 27 years when she presented with oral ulcers, photosensitive rash, arthritis, pleuritis, positive ANA and positive dsDNA antibody. She started hydroxychloroquine with control of her symptoms after a brief steroid taper. At age 31 she developed nephritis, Class IV and V on renal biopsy. She was treated with intravenous 'pulse' methylprednisolone, rituximab (two doses of 1 gm each) and mycophenolate 2000 mg daily. She continues on the mycophenolate 2000 mg daily, enalapril 20 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg daily. Her serum creatinine has been 1.2 mg/dl, and her dsDNA antibody is low positive with mildly low C3 and normal C4 (markedly improved from her initial onset of nephritis). The urine protein/creatinine ratio is 1100 mg/gm, down from 3700 mg at onset of nephritis and stable over the last year. She is not in a relationship now but wants to preserve her ability to have biological children in the future and she is very concerned that she will develop recurrent nephritis. She has decided she would like to freeze her eggs and asks your opinion. a. aPL (LAC, aCL, ab2GPI) are all negative b. aPL are 'triple positive', with high levels of LAC, aCL and ab2GPI Discussion Point •The best way to assess and guide a patient with SLE who is planning oocyte cryopreservation, in the setting of negative and positive aPL Learning Objectives •Explain the importance of safe and effective contraception for women with SLE at risk for unintended pregnancy and be able to assess patients and recommend the best options for them •Describe the risks of ovarian stimulation for patients with SLE, with and without aPL, and suggest and discuss specific management options with the reproductive endocrinologist Case 3: 36-year-old female seeking pregnancy counselling Rebecca Fischer-Betz Maggy is a 36-year-old female office assistant with 8-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Past manifestations of SLE included polyarthritis, pleuritis, positive ANA and dsDNA antibodies and low complement. She had been initially treated with corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine. Two years ago she had a flare with polyarthritis and treatment with methotrexate was added. Currently she is feeling well. She asks about the possibility of a pregnancy. Her menstruation is regular and has had no previous pregnancies. Laboratory tests revealed Hb 12,8 g/dl; Plt 233 K/ml; leucocytes 3.800/ml; Anti-dsDNA 122 (< 80 IU/ml), complement is normal. She is presently taking methotrexate 12.5 mg sc/week and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day.

A human knee model study,Knee,,1873-5800,10.1016/j.knee.2021.02.026,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2011275148&from=export,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. Conclusion: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered.",2021,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,381-389,,"(Blanke F., fblanke@gmx.de; Oehler N.; Vogt S.)

The aim of our study was to verify mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT) in alcohol-related liver cirrhosis (ALC) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. One hundred forty-two patients with ALC, 92 with NAFLD, and 68 in control group were enrolled in this study. Hematological indices (MPV, PCT, and PDW) and serological (indirect and direct) markers of liver fibrosis (AAR, APRI, FIB-4, GPR, PICP, PIIINP, TGF-, PDGF-AB, laminin) were measured in each participant. MELD score in ALC patients and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) together with BARD score in the NAFLD group were also obtained. Results were compared between research and control groups. Then, a correlation between evaluated indices was performed in study groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) and area under the curve (AUC) values were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of measured indices. Significant increase in PDW and decrease in PCT in comparison to controls were noted in examined ALC (60.4% vs. 51.2% and 0.1% vs. 0.21%, respectively, p<0.0001) and NAFLD (54.75% vs. 51.2% and 0.19 vs. 0.21%, respectively, p<0.01) patients. Decreased level of MPV was observed in NAFLD group (7.85 fl vs. 8.90 fl, p<0.0001). Additionally, PCT correlated with NFS (p<0.0001). Evaluated PLT indices correlated with MELD score (MPV and PDW, p<0.001; PCT, p<0.05). They correlated with indirect and direct markers of liver fibrosis in the whole research group, too. PCT was the parameter with the greatest diagnostic accuracy in ALC patients (AUC=0,839 for cutoff<0.17%); in NAFLD group, it was MPV (AUC=0,808 for cutoff<7.9 fl).

Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Purpose: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30° of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. Results: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 ± 0.62 vs 7.0 ± 2.18 mm, respectively; P <.001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 ± 8.27, 50.9 ± 8.50, and 1.8 ± 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 ± 2.61, 95.2 ± 2.64, and 6.8 ± 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P <.001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred.

There is no published literature regarding the anthropometric predictors for the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft obtained in ACL reconstruction through the inframalleolar approach. Methods: Fifty-two patients were finally evaluated for anthropometric parameters to predict quadrupled PLT graft diameter in ACL reconstruction using the inframalleolar technique. Intraoperative quadrupled PLT graft diameter was correlated to the patient’s anthropometric data such as age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. We used regression analysis in a stepwise manner to ascertain anthropometric indices associated with the graft diameter. Results: This study included 46 males and six females. Mean age was 28.2 ± 7.4 years, mean height was 172.7 ± 2.8 cm, mean weight was 75.6 ± 3.4 kg, mean BMI was 25.3 ± 0.9 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 9.2 ± 3.9 months, and mean graft diameter was 9.3 ± 0.4 mm. Positive correlation with graft diameter was found only with height (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and weight (r = 0.4, P < 0.01). On analysing through linear regression, height and weight had significant association with graft diameter, and we formulated the following prediction equation: PLT graft diameter (mm) = 0.083 × height (cm) + 0.011 × weight (kg)-5.854. Conclusion: Patients’ characteristics, including height and weight, have a significant correlation with quadrupled PLT graft diameter and the average diameter of graft is > 9 mm through this approach.",2021,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,377-384,,5,11,,Int.

Recently, it is designated as a promising graft option for ACLR. The effect of harvesting PLTG on donor ankle function is still not completely understood. Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT) is thought to play a major role in proprioceptive regulation of the ankle joint. All the studies till date did cross-sectional assessments of ankle and foot function at or after 6 months that might have overlooked the timely detection of donor site morbidities. Aim: To evaluate the ankle function and compare the affected and sound limb function in subjects with an ACLR with autologous PLTG starting at an early postoperative visit upto six months. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary rehabilitation center from March 2019 to March 2021 including the follow-up evaluation. As per the inclusion criteria, 63 participants after ACLR with PLTG were considered for assessment using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hind foot scale and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scale at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-ACLR follow-up. Comparison between sound and affected limbs was done during all follow-ups. The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. Both FAAM and AOFAS ankle and foot scores were analysed with non parametric tests. Results: Mean Age of 63 participants were 29.25 years. Median of AOFAS and FAAM score at 6 week, 3 month, and 6 month post-ACLR follow-ups were (88, 98 and 100) and (97.22, 98.80 and 100), respectively. Statistically significant increase in AOFAS and FAAM scores were observed at 3 month and 6 month as compared to 6 week follow-ups with p=0.001 and p-value=0.001 respectively. The group comparison between the affected and sound side functional scores at different study visits showed statistically significant greater values for the sound ankle than the affected ankle (FAAM: 6 week: p-value=0.001; 3 month: p-value=0.001; 6 month: p-value=0.001 and AOFAS p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The evaluation of functional outcomes showed gradual and linear improvement at subsequent postoperative visits and restores fully to 100% at 6 month indicating a near-normal to normal donor ankle function following ACLR with PLTG by 6 months.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ± 6.73, and 29.6 ± 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision. Allograft ACL reconstruction is a good alternative to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon graft.",2021,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,58-62,,1,88,,Acta Chir. Orthop.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients (38 males, 14 females; mean age: 29.2±7.7 years; range, 17 to 51 years) who received PLT autograft for ACL reconstruction in our center between July 2018 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the patients and leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters were recorded before the operation. The PLT autograft diameter and length were measured during surgery. RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation was found between the graft diameter and length and weight, height, body mass index (BMI), leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant correlation between the graft diameter and length and age (p>0.05). Distal leg diameter had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft diameter (r=0.956), while the height had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft length (r=0.982). CONCLUSION: Anthropometric parameters of height, weight, BMI, leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters may be helpful for surgeons to predict the diameter and length of the PLT autograft before surgery.

HYPOTHESIS: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. RESULTS: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 ± 0.40 vs 2.09 ± 0.54 N, respectively; P = .006) (stiffness: 3.43 ± 0.56 vs 1.75 ± 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P < .001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 ± 1.13 vs 7.14 ± 0.94 N, respectively; P = .008) (stiffness: 4.45 ± 0.75 vs 3.36 ± 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P = .008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 ± 4.98 vs 5.16 ± 3.98, respectively; P < .001) (EA: 19.66 ± 7.19 vs 10.85 ± 2.16, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 ± 5.04 vs 17.11 ± 7.31, respectively; P = .010) (MT: 21.15 ± 2.58 vs 15.55 ± 4.48, respectively; P = .041) (EA: 20.75 ± 3.87 vs 10.64 ± 3.94, respectively; P = .003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 ± 8.05 vs 15.21 ± 7.60, respectively; P = .007) (EA: 25.19 ± 6.38 vs 13.94 ± 7.10, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 ± 4.45 vs 47.80 ± 6.16, respectively; P < .001) (MT: 33.15 ± 3.88 vs 13.76 ± 4.07, respectively; P < .001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 ± 17.49 vs 182.97 ± 14.35 μm, respectively; P < .001), 8 weeks (58.86 ± 10.99 vs 90.15 ± 11.53 μm, respectively; P = .002), and 12 weeks (42.70 ± 7.96 vs 67.29 ± 6.55 μm, respectively; P = .001) than in the HB group. CONCLUSION: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction may result in improved biomechanical properties and tendon-bone incorporation compared with a hybrid graft. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Augmenting small autografts with allograft tissue may result in decreased biomechanical performance and worse tendon-bone incorporation, increasing the risk of graft failure.",2020,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,3515-3524,,14,48,,Am J Sports Med,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546520967668,,animal; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; diagnostic imaging; male; micro-computed tomography; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; tendon; transplantation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To obtain a more standardized product in combination with increased blood safety, plasma pooling followed by pathogen inactivation (PI) seems to be a promising approach. The pooling of 5 single donor plasma units allows to split the pool finally into 6 therapeutic FFP doses (≥200 mL/dose), enabling the introduction of such a manufacturing process with a lower economical impact. Aims: Validation and routine production of pools of 5 SDP units resulting in 6 pathogen-reduced (PR) FFP units. Methods: Five ABO-compatible whole-blood derived SDP units (≥ 270 ml) were collected from different donors and pooled using the DONOpack™ plasma pooling set (LMB Technologie). Subsequently the pool was split into 2 equal mini-pools which were treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System (Cerus). Each PR mini-pool was split into 3 (≥200 ml) therapeutic platelet units, the final product was frozen within 8 h of collection (FFP). Samples of the final product were collected to assess the plasma quality by testing the white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) contamination with an automated, blood analyzer (XN-550, Sysmex). The total protein (TP) content was analyzed on a Konelab biochemistry analyzer (Thermo Fisher). The coagulation factor activity (FVIII, Fibrinogen) was assessed with an ACL Elite Pro coagulation analyzer (Werfen). Results: During the validation phase, 44 PR pools of 5 SDP units were produced resulting in 264 single FFP units with a volume of ≥ 200 mL respectively. RBC contamination was below the limit of detection (0.01 x 106/mL) in all PR pools. The average WBC contamination of all PR pools was 0.005 × 106/mL (±0.004) with a maximum of 0.011 × 106/mL. The average PLT contamination of all PR pools was 0.3 × 106/mL (±0.9) with a maximum of 5.0 × 106/mL. The average TP content was 59.7 g/L (±2.7) with a minimum of 54 g/L. The average FVIII content of PR pools was 75 IU/100 mL (±21.1); the median was 71.0 IU. With a minimum of 49 IU/ 100 mL, one pool was below 50 IU/100 mL (blood group O). The average Fibrinogen activity of PR pools was 226.0 mg/dL (±17.4), the median was 224.0 mg/dL with a minimum of 191 mg/dL. The average fibrinogen recovery was 80.4% (±4.3) with a minimum of 71.0%. Routine QC data from 31 additional pools was available to date. The average RBC contamination of all PR pools was 0.01 × 106/mL (±0.004) with a maximum of 0.2 × 106/mL. The average WBC contamination of all PR pools was 0.001 × 106/mL (±0.001) with a maximum of 0.03 × 106/mL. The average PLT contamination of all PR pools was 2 × 106/mL (±2.2) with a maximum of 11.0 × 106/mL. The average FVIII content of PR pools was 85.7 IU/100 mL (±26.9); the median was 81.0 IU/100 mL. With a minimum of 46 IU/100 mL, one pool was below 50 IU/100 mL (blood group O). The average Fibrinogen activity of PR pools was 206.5 mg/dL (±38.2), the median was 198.0 mg/dL with a minimum of 125 mg/ dL.

The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. Method: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. Result: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length.

Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcome and donor site morbidity of single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus tendon graft. This study considers the usage of peroneus longus tendon autograft as a graft of choice in ACL reconstruction. Material and methods: This prospective study was done across two different tertiary hospitals from April 2017 to June 2020. A total of 100 patients gave informed consent to be included in this study and underwent single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneous tendon graft. The functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm score) were recorded before the surgery and after the surgery. Results: Out of 100, 80 patients were male and 20 patients were female. Mean age of the patients was 27.25 ± 9.11 with range from 19 to 46 years old. Injury mechanism of the patients was motorcycle accident 7 patients, sport injury 75 patients, and others injury 18 patients. Diameter of the peroneus longus graft was measured and recorded intraoperative, and the result peroneus longus graft mean diameter was 8.55 ± 0.73 mm. The mean of thigh circumference at 10 cm from upper pole of patella bone was 44.77 ± 2.87 at injury site and 45.95 ± 2.97 at contralateral site. The mean of thigh circumference at 20 cm from upper pole of patella bone was 52.77 ± 3.73 at injury site and 53.83 ± 3.55 at contralateral site.

Several hemostatic changes have been reported after exercise in the horse but data available differs. Over the last few years, studies have been performed mostly in course of acute exercise. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the hemostatic modifications in young untrained Thoroughbred racehorses in the first 4âmonth timeframe incremental training period in order to develop advanced training programs for equine athletes and to prevent hemorrhagic syndromes. Methods: Twentyânine clinically healthy, untrained, 2âyearâold Thoroughbred racehorses were followed during their incremental 4â month sprint exercise schedule. Blood collection was performed once a month, five times (Tâ30, T0, T30, T60, and T90). For each time blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into vacutainer tubes with EDTA for measurement of the platelet count (Plt; Sysmex XT1800) and with sodium citrate to evaluate Clotting parameters (Prothrombin TimeâPT, Activated Partial Prothrombin TimeâAPTT, Thrombin timeâ TT and fibrinogenâFb concentrations using standard kits for ACL TOP coagulometer) and platelet aggregation in plateletârich plasmaâPRP prepared by centrifugation at 120 g for 15 min (light transmission aggregometry, APACTâ4, Helena). Platelet aggregation was measured in response to various agonists: 1, 5, and 10 μM adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 4 μg/mL collagen and 5 μM of calcium ionophore A23187. Platelet function was also evaluated using the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFAâ100) using collagen/ADP and collagen/adrenaline cartridges, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differences among the time points were analyzed (KruskalâWallis oneâway analysis of variance, Dunn's Multiple comparison postâtest, Fisher's exact test) and meanSEM were calculated (Graph Pad Statistics software). Results: Significant modifications were identified compared with Tâ30 for Plt count and clotting parameters assessed at T30. Plasma Fb levels increased (173 7 vs 148 6.5 mg/dL), PT and TT were shorter (15.2 0.2 vs 16.8 0.1 sec and 16 0.1 vs 18 0.1 sec, respectively) with concomitant increase of platelet aggregation induced by collagen (32.6 4.8 vs 21.6 4.9%), ADP 1 μM (35.5 2.0 vs 24.5 3.1%), and A23187 (30 4.7 vs 23.8 4%) and a shorter closure time of CâADP cartridges on the PFAâ100analyser (75.6 4.4 vs 87.7 3.4 sec). All these parameters tend to return to baseline value at T90. Conclusions: The first longâterm training period was found to induce hypercoagulability and platelet hyperreactivity already after 30 days in untrained Thoroughbreds.

Methods: Eighty healthy New Zealand white rabbits were harvested to prepare ACL injury models and randomly divided into two groups ( n=40). The ACL was reconstructed with vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft in group A and peroneus longus tendon graft without blood supply in group B. The survival of animals and the healing of incision were observed after operation; the grafts were taken for gross and histological observations at 4, 8, and 16 weeks; the biomechanical test of the grafts was carried out to record the maximum tensile strength and incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks. Results: All animals survived until the experiment completed. General observation showed that the tunnel was combined with grafts, the vascular infiltration was abundant, and no obvious boundary between the tunnel and grafts existed at 16 weeks in group A; there was still an obvious boundary between the tunnel and graft in group B. Histological observation showed that the collagen fibers between tendon and bone in group A increased gradually, the dense fiber connection was formed, and the ""tidal-line"" like structure similar to the normal ACL insertion was formed at 16 weeks; but the""tidal-line"" like structure was not obvious in group B. Biomechanical test showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks between group A and group B ( P=0.680; P=0.590), but the maximum tensile strength at 8 and 16 weeks were higher in group A than in group B ( t=18.503, P=0.001; t=25.391, P=0.001).

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 35 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy between October 2017 and October 2018. There were 19 males and 16 females with an average age of 43.4 years (range, 18-60 years), with 20 cases of left knee and 15 cases of right knee. The causes of injury included traffic accident in 14 cases, falling injury in 13 cases, and sports injury in 8 cases. The time from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean, 4.7 days). The patients suffered from swelling, pain, and limited mobility of knee joint before operation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were positive before operation, whereas MRI was taken to confirm the ACL rupture. After operation, the patients were followed up every 3 months until the knee joint's function returned to normal. MRI and X-ray films were used to observe the tendon-bone healing as well as the position of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were conducted to observe the improvement of knee joint mobility. The functional improvements were evaluated by the International Knee Documents Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee injury and osteoarthritis (KOOS) score. Results: All the 35 patients were followed up 12-18 months, with an average of 14.2 months. The incisions healed by first intention, and no complications such as infection, joint stiffness, and rerupture occurred. Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test turned to be negative of all patients. MRI showed that the ACL was continuous, and the tendon-bone in the distal femur tunnel and proximal tibia tunnel recovered well after operation. X-ray films showed that the positions of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail were stable. The IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with those before operation, and the scores were further improved with time after operation ( P<0.05).

The incidence rate reaches 68.6 cases per 100,000 people per year. Management of ACL injuries for individuals who want to return to the level of exercise activity as before, mostly in the form of reconstructive surgery. As many as 60,000 to 175,000 cases of ACL reconstruction per year are carried out in the United States At present, many reconstructive surgeries are performed by taking tendon grafts on the patient's own body (autograft) to then be used instead of the ACL. The most widely used graft sources are Hamstring and Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone (BPTB) grafts. Other alternative grafts are Quadriceps tendon, Fascia Lata, Iliotibial Band, and Peroneus Longus Tendon. Each graft retrieval technique has advantages and disadvantages. BPTB graft has the best tensile strength and bone union with bone, but the complications of anterior knee pain are also quite common (5-55%). Hamstring grafts and Quadriceps grafts minimize the complications of anterior knee pain, with fairly good tensile strength, but the union of grafts with bone takes longer. The loss of Hamstring tendons also causes a decrease in muscle strength in Hamstring, where Hamstring has an important role in preventing the anterior translation of the tibia Peroneus Longus Tendon graft is an alternative graft developed to minimize complications associated with graft use from the area around the knee. Peroneus Longus tendons also have tensile strength similar to Hamstring tendons. As with other graft extracts, Peroneus Longus tendon graft is also accompanied by complications in the donor site. Possible complications arising from the loss of the Peroneus Longus tendon include ankle instability and decreased flexion strength of the 1st ray and ankle eversion. Research carried out by Bancha et al showed a reduction in flexion strength of 1st ray and ankle eversion significantly, without any instability in the ankle. Peroneus longus provides 5.5% strength for moderate dorsiflexion for ankle eversion movements, peroneus longus is the main muscle. But in other studies it is said that the use of peroneus longus graft does not interfere with the stability of the ankle and ROM. Does not even affect the functional outcome of the ankle However, in a study conducted by Bancha et al and Kerimoglu et al., The technique used for taking Peroneus Longus graft tendons did not include suturing in the distal stump of Peroneous Longus. So with this study, researchers wanted to find out whether different results would be found related to donor site complications if the technique used included suturing the distal stump of the Peroneus Longus tendon against the peroneus brevis tendon",2020,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,,,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04431063,,adult; ankle instability; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; clinical trial; complication; controlled study; donor site; exercise; fascia lata; flexural strength; fracture healing; hamstring muscle; hamstring tendon; human; knee pain; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; quadriceps tendon; reconstructive surgery; sport injury; surgery; tendon; tendon graft; tensile strength; tibia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of isolated ACL tears remain a common orthopaedic injury with significant increase in the rate of ACL reconstruction over time. Several types of autografts used for ACL reconstruction have some potential occurrence of donor site morbidity, including Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone (BPTB), hamstring tendon, and quadriceps tendon. Peroneus longus tendon can be an option as a graft donor because it has biomechanical characteristics that are not significantly different from the hamstring tendon. Purpose : The aim of the study was to evaluate the functional outcome and donor site morbidity of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Methods : This study was an observational analytical with retrospective cohort design using medical record. The functional outcomes were assessed with IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm, and KSS scoring system 12 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed with AOFAS and FADI scoring system, eversion strength, and plantarflexion strength. Results : Seventy five patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (59 males and 16 females). Mean of peroneus longus tendon graft diameters were 8.39 ± 0.69 mm (range 6.5-10 mm).

However, one of the considerations in choosing autograft is donor site morbidity. This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantar flexion strength between donor site and its contralateral. Hypothesis : The study hypothesis was that the eversion and first ray plantar flexion muscle strength were different between harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Methods: From March 2017 to December 2018, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft were included in this study. From the first day after surgery, the patients followed rehabilitation protocol. Ankle eversion and first ray plantar flexion strength were measured using a modifieddynamometer 6-months after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scoring system for ankle and hindfoot. Results: Thirty-one patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with 22 males and 9 females, ranging from 18-45 years of age (mean: 27.58±8.69). There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at donor site compared to contralateral (p=0.54) with means 65.87±7.63 N and 66.96±8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantar flexion strength at donor site compared to contralateral (p=0.68) with means 150.64±11.67 N and 152.10±12.16 N, respectively. The FADI score of 99.71±0.57 and AOFAS score of 98.71±3.03 were considered excellent results.

Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the two graft materials for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament with peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon by meta-analysis. METHODS: We retrieved controlled clinical trials which compared the long peroneal tendons and hamstring tendons in reconstructing anterior cruciate ligament respectively in Chinese database (WanFang, CNKI, VIP, Chinese biological medicine) and English database (Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane library). The retrieval time was from database creation to March 2019. Literature screening and evaluation and data extraction were performed by two evaluators. Meta-analysis was evaluated using Revman5. 3 software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) A total of 413 Chinese or English literatures were retrieved and 10 of them were included in the final analysis. Among 647 patients receiving anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 271 patients used peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and 376 patients used hamstring tendon reconstruction. (2) Meta-analysis results: Postoperative functional score: There was significant difference in Lysholm score at postoperative 12 months (MD=1. 23, 95%C/[0. 31, 2. 51], P=0. 000 9) and IKDC score at postoperative 6 months (MD=3. 19, 95%C/[0. 07, 6. 31], P=0. 02) between peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and hamstring tendon groups. The occurrence of postoperative complications in the peroneus longus tendon group was significantly lower than that in the hamstring tendon group (OR=0. 15, 95%C/[0. 03, 0. 69], P=0. 01). However, there were no significant differences in Tegner scores, degree of joint motion, degree of joint relaxation at postoperative 6 and 12 months between peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and hamstring tendon groups. No significant difference was found in Lysholm score at postoperative 6 months and in IKDC score at postoperative 12 months between these two groups. The results showed that the clinical effect of peroneus longus tendon in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament was comparable to that of hamstring tendon; in the peroneus longus tendon reconstruction group, the Lysholm score at postoperative 12 months and IKDC score at postoperative 6 months were significantly superior to those in the hamstring tendon group. The incidence of postoperative complications in the peroneus longus tendon reconstruction group was lower than that in the hamstring tendon group. The peroneus longus tendon can be clinically recommended to substitute hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

At present, ligament autografts have been the best method due to good histocompatibility, rapid healing, no cross-contamination, and low cost of treatment. However, autografts do not have infinite amount and are also not always feasible. Anterior half of peroneus longus tenden autograft is likely to become a source of autograft with many advantages. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT). AIM: To evaluate the initial outcome of ACL reconstruction arthroscopy by anterior half of peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This is a prospective non-controlled case series. RESULTS: A prospective study on 30 patients (from 9 / 2016 to 01 / 2019) had both ACL and MCL injury who had operated ACL reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT) at Department of General Orthopaedic and Trauma, Viet Duc hospital. Our outcome: the year average 35.4 ys, the rate of ACL rupture combined with meniscus injury was 40%. The average diameter AHPLT autograft is 7.0 mm. The function Lysholm scores improved from 59 to 94.27 postoperative 6 months. No difference beetwen the AOFAS scale of preoperative and postoperative.

Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 ± 0.7 mm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 ± 0.8 mm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 ± 4.2 and for the FADI 98 ± 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.

However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. Results: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 ± 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P =.55), with means of 65.87 ± 7.63 N and 66.96 ± 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P =.68), with means of 150.64 ± 11.67 N and 152.10 ± 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 ± 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 ± 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. Conclusion: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity.

Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. Methods: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000 cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. Findings: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x < 40 yo, 40 yo ≤ x < 60 yo, 60 yo < x). Interpretation: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness.",2019,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,90-95,,"(Wong A.K.; Schaffler B.C.; Carrero L.C.; Neufeld E.V.; Grande D.A., dgrande@northwell.edu) Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, United States",67,,Clin.

Methods: Between June 2015 and February 2018, 28 patients with ACL rupture and MCL grade Ⅲ injury were treated. Arthroscopic GraftLink technique was used to reconstruct ACL with autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), and suture anchor fixation was used to repair MCL. There were 22 males and 6 females, aged 21-47 years, with an average age of 30.4 years. The cause of injury included traffic accident in 18 cases, falling from height in 7 cases, and sports injury in 3 cases. The time from injury to admission was 1-2 weeks, with an average of 1.3 weeks. The preoperative Lysholm score of knee joint was 46.8±3.0 and the International Knee Documentation Commission (IKDC) score was 49.2±2.7. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of ankle joint was 98.29±0.72. Both Lachman test and valgus stress test were positive. There were 8 cases of meniscus injury and 2 cases of cartilage injury. Results: The operation time ranged from 55 to 90 minutes, with an average of 72.5 minutes. All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no complications related to operation occurred. All patients were followed up 6-38 months, with an average of 20.7 months. At 3 months after operation, the range of motion of the knee joint was 116- 132°, with an average of 122°. Lachman test showed that the anterior translation more than 5 mm in 2 cases, and the others were negative; while the valgus stress test showed that all patients were positive. At 6 months after operation, the Lysholm score and IKDC score of knee joint were 90.2±1.8 and 93.5±2.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than preoperative scores ( t=31.60, P=0.00; t=29.91, P=0.01); AOFAS score of ankle joint was 97.86±0.68, with no significant difference compared with preoperative score ( t=2.89, P=0.08). KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases.

Methods: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. Results: Ultimate load to failure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 ± 49.6 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87 N) versus 719.6 ± 69.6 N (95% CI, 671.38-767.82 N; P =.044). Less graft elongation at failure was observed in the supplemented group (3.1 ± 1.5 mm; 95% CI, 2.07-4.17 mm) versus the control group (21.0 ± 21.2 mm; 95% CI, 6.31-35.69 mm; P =.052). The number of grafts undergoing a 5-mm or greater change in length at failure was 1 of 8 in the supplemented group versus 5 of 8 in the control group (P =.038). Conclusions: Inner-limb supplemental tibial fixation results in higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation in a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside ACL reconstruction graft construct. Clinical Relevance: The weak point of a single-tendon, quadrupled, all-inside ACL graft construct is the tendon-to-tendon suturing to secure the inner limbs of the graft.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. Methods. Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE.

Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. Results. The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P = 0 0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P = 0 017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. Conclusions. Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.",2019,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,"(Sun J.; Jia J.; Xie Q.; Peng S.; Yi L., yilitj@hotmail.com) Department of Neurology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China",2019,,J.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle. PLT is a suitable alternative autograft for an ACL reconstruction in patients with a concomitant grade III MCL injury without a significant biomechanical disadvantage to the ankle donor site.,2019,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,804-811,,8,32,,J.

METHODS: The levels of serum s-Eng were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 139 patients with APS, 44 patients with SLE but no APS, 37 patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), 23 patients with Bechet's disease (BD), 22 patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and 22 persistent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) positive individuals without SLE or APS (simply aCL positive group) and 87 health controls (HC) without any auto-immune diseases. These APS patients included 64 primary APS patients and 75 APS patients secondary to SLE.The correlation between the clinical data, laboratory parameters, and serum s-Eng levels were analyzed.Independent samples t test, paired t test, Chi-square Test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's χ2 test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: (1) The serum levels of s-Eng were significantly higher in the patients with APS whether primary or secondary to SLE than in the health controls and simply aCL positive group and the patients with other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, pSS, BD and SSc (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum s-Eng levels between simply aCL positive group and health controls [(5.17±2.00) mg/L vs. (5.04±1.11) mg/L, P>0.05]. (2) The best cut-off value for the diagnosis of APS was no less than 8.37 mg/L as mean ± 3SD value, with the sensitivity at 0.772 and the specificity at 0.928. The Youden index was 0.700. These results indicated good validity of s-Eng as a diagnostic marker for APS. (3) The proportions of artery thrombosis and pathological pregnancy were higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than that in s-Eng-negative group (46/81 vs. 19/58, 29/65 vs. 10/44, respectively, all P<0.05). The levels of PLT were lower in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients (72.00×109/L vs. 119.00×109/L, P<0.001). (4) The proportions of the presence (93.83% vs. 37.93%, P<0.001) and titer (61.70 U/mL vs. 15.45 U/mL, P<0.001) of aCL were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group. The proportions of the presence (61.73% vs. 43.10%, P<0.05) and titer (33.48 U/mL vs.17.40 U/mL, P<0.05) of anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group too.

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 156 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with the PLT graft at our institution. Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, gender, age, duration of injury, and preinjury activity levels, were recorded. t tests, correlation coefficients (Pearson r), and a multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter of the graft obtained. The mean PLT graft diameter was 8.3 mm, and 21 patients (13.5%) had a diameter less than 8 mm; 85 patients (54.5%) had a diameter between 8 and 9 mm, and 50 patients (32.0%) had a diameter greater than or equal to 9 mm. The correlation analysis showed that height (P < .001), weight (P < .001), and duration of injury (P = .012) were significantly related to graft diameter. On the basis of these 3 predictors, the following regression equation was obtained: Diameter = 2.28 + 0.028∗height (cm) + 0.013∗weight (kg) + 0.289∗duration of injury (0 or 1). Patients who were short and shin were more likely to own smaller graft diameters (<8 mm), especially the one ruptured his or her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) over 3 months.

Two apheresis PLTs were allocated and issued at about 11 am and transfused within the next hour. There were no signs of a transfusion reaction noted during or immediately after the transfusion but approximately 30 minutes after completing the out-patient visit, the patient returned to the Emergency Department (ED) with fever and chills. Blood cultures were collected and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Initial thought was that the patient's central line (port) was contaminated. The following evening the septic symptoms were linked to the transfusion and a transfusion reaction was reported to the transfusion service (TS). Study Design/Method: The blood supplier was notified of the transfusion reaction, but the original PLT containers were no longer available for culture. The 1st unit transfused had a concurrent plasma available and a second PLT container from this same collection that was transfused to a patient in another hospital facility without any reports of adverse reactions. The 2nd unit transfused was part of a triple collection with a 2nd container returned to the blood supplier due to the presence of clots on the 4th day after collection. The 3rd PLT container from the 2nd unit transfused had been transfused to a post-bone marrow transplant patient about 6:30 am on the same day as the other transfused container with no signs or symptoms of a transfusion reaction. Cultures from the concurrent plasma of the 1st unit transfused were negative, but cultures from the clotted PLT from the 2nd unit transfused were positive and identified as Methicillin-susceptible Staph-ylococcus aureus. Blood cultures from the septic patient also grew Methicil-lin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Results/Finding: The initial culture performed on the parent PLT product by the blood center was sampled 24 hours after the collection and was negative after 5 days incubation on the BACT/ALERT® instrument; additionally, the initial samples were subsequently plated after notification of the transfusion reaction and found to be negative. All 3 PLT containers from the sus-pect collection were tested at the hospital using point of issue bacterial testing (Verax Platelet PGD® Test) on midnight of day 3 into day 4 and found to be negative for the presence of bacteria. S. aureus from the patient blood culture and the positive PLT container were sent for genotyping and found to be identical, indicating that the patient's septic reaction was caused by the transfused PLT product. Conclusion: Although point of issue bacterial screening was performed, it appears that the level of bacteria was below the limit of detection which may have resulted in the false negative results. On the clinical side, even after symptoms of a reaction were present, the initial assumption was that the patient had a central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI). Discussion with clinical staff shows that the current CLABSI investigation process does not include checking to see if blood products have recently been given that may have caused patient to be septic. The other lesson learned was that the TS did not realize that the clot found in one of the containers might indicate the presence bacteria and that the co-components should have been removed from the inventory.",2018,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,117A-118A,,"(Aronson C.A.)

Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12 h compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3 mm for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement. PURPOSE: A common problem during ACL reconstruction is asymmetry of proximal-distal graft diameter leading to tunnel upsizing and graft-tunnel mismatch. Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. METHOD: Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5-1 mm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70-220 N for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young's modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer's solution at 37 °C and the CSA recorded over 12 h.

However, the associations between cartilage damage and degeneration during PTOA development and patient-reported outcomes in the patients with ACL injury are still unclear. We previously reported that T1ρ and T2 of cartilage of posterolateral tibia (pLT) after ACL injury were associated with Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 1-year after ACL injury. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the longitudinal changes of T1ρ and T2 values in the knee cartilage after acute ACL injury and reconstruction, and 2) to investigate the relationship between cartilage damage after ACL injury evaluated by MRI T1ρ and T2 mapping and KOOS at 3-year after surgery. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, bilateral knees were scanned using a 3 Tesla MRI T1ρ and T2 mapping for 36 patients with ACL injury (age = 31.49 ± 7.61 years, BMI = 23.87± 2.52 kg/m2, 15 female) at baseline (prior to surgical reconstruction), 6 month, 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery and 14 healthy controls (age = 31.38 ± 4.89 years, BMI = 23.61± 1.87 kg/m2, 5 female) at baseline, 1 and 3 years. Fourteen sub-compartments of the knee cartilage were semi-automatically segmented (Fig. 1). The mean and standard deviation of T1ρ and T2 values of each defined cartilage compartments were calculated. Patients also completed KOOS at baseline, 6 month, 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery. Linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, BMI were built to evaluate the association between cartilage T1ρ or T2 at baseline and KOOS at 3-year. Results: Significant larger increases of cartilage T1ρ and T2 from baseline to 3 year were observed in the injured knee of patients compared to controls in medial femoral condyle (MFC) for T1ρ and T2, and in medial tibia (MT) for T1ρ only (Table 1). The increases of cartilage T1ρ and T2 were fastest for the first 6-month (Fig. 2 showing MFC as an example), constituting 84.9 and 86.3% of the increase from baseline to 3-year, respectively. Linear regression analysis showed that higher cartilage T1ρ of pLT at baseline was associated with worse KOOS quality of life (b = -2.285, p = 0.029, Fig. 3). Conclusions: Significant increases in cartilage T1ρ and T2 of the medial side were observed at 3-years after ACL reconstruction, indicating early degeneration of the joint in patients after ACL injury. Very interestingly, the most increases occurred in the first 6-month after ACL reconstruction, suggesting the early cartilage degeneration may be caused more by the toxic biochemical environment after ACL injury and surgery, rather than the biomechanical factors which may cause the continuous but smaller increase at later stages (after 6-month). T1ρ of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS at 3-year after ACL reconstruction, implying the severity of damages to cartilage during ACL rupture can be potential predictor for patient long-term outcomes. These findings suggest quantitative MRI can be used as powerful tools for detecting very early degenerative changes in the knee after ACL injury and for identifying patients who have worse clinic outcomes to allow early interventions in these patients, and thus, improve patient management.",2018,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,S49-S50,,"(Mamoto K.; Xu K.; Maz C.; Li X.)

At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up.

Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site.

Methods: Sixty-eight peroneus longus (PL) Bioclense® treated allograft tendons were fashioned into either four-or single-strand configuration and the following assessed: changes in cross-sectional area following compression and soaking in Ringer's solution at 37°C; cyclic strain (70-220 N) for 1000 cycles; ultimate failure load; stiffness; ultimate tensile strength; Young's modulus; stability at the tunnel aperture in porcine femurs under cyclic loading. Results: A mean decrease in CSA of 16.4% (Pb0.001) under a stress of 471 kPa and 13.1% (Pb0.001) under a stress of 447 kPa was observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19.4% over 12 hours compared to 1.5% for controls (Pb0.004). No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability. Conclusions: No detrimental biomechanical effects on allograft PL tendons were found. Compressed tendons significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability. Graft compression aids ease of graft passage, anatomic positioning within the attachment and preservation of bone stock during ACL reconstruction.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,IX,,6,24,,Knee,,,,,,,,English,,,Embase,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2017.08.029,,allograft; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; compression; controlled study; femur; in vitro study; joint; nonhuman; physiological stress; pig; rigidity; Ringer solution; simulation; tendon; tensile strength,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) may have thrombotic and bleeding complications with increased morbidity and mortality. Age, previous history of thrombosis, elevated white cell counts and JAK2 allele burden are considered risk factors for both arterial (ATE) and venous (VTE) thrombosis while elevated platelet counts and qualitative defects of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with bleeds. ADAMTS13 regulates the pro-thrombotic activities of the VWF: reduced levels of ADAMTS13 or VWF activities expose patients to increased risk of thrombosis or bleeds. Aims: to evaluate whether or not the reduced activities of ADAMTS13/VWF were associated with thrombotic/bleeding complications, 72 patients with ET diagnosed according to WHO criteria at the Hematology Center of the L. Sacco University Hospital of Milan have been observed prospectively during a 36-month follow-up. Methods: Patients were exposed to all the diagnostic tests required for ET diagnosis and signed an informed consent for these ADAMTS13/VWF evaluations. VWF (VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag) activities and FVIII were measured in citrated plasma by the automatic ACL-TOP systems using commercially available reagent kits while ADAMTS-13 by TECHNOZYM activity ELISA. Statistical analyses among the cases with or without complications were performed with SPSS. Results: the cohort of ET patients was positive for JAK2(59%)/MPL(5%)/CALR(12%) with negative mutations in 17 cases. 3 different groups were found in this cohort: A)NOCOMPL=39/72(54.2%);B)ATE/VTE=22/72(30.5%);C)BLEEDS=11/72(15.2). The following clinical-lab data [median(range) according to these A/B/C groups are: M-F=11-28/5-17/3-8; Age=68(17-88)/73(33-89)/64(38-80);Plt-counts(/uL)=566(430-780)/559(398-551)/704(478-1342);VWF:ACT(U/dL)=98(76-238)/163(86-282)/63(27-92); ADAMTS13(U/dL)=86(56-144)/45(31-105)/85(49/152);VWF:ACT/Ag:ratio=0.85(0.7-1.4)/0.75(0.6-1.2)/0.65(0.2/0.8); ADAMTS13/VWF:ACTratio=0.74(0.41-1.8)/0.54(0.25/1.2)/0.76(0.5-2.5). Liver and/or spleen enlargement was found in 23/72(32%) of all A/B/C patients but did not correlate with complications. A total of 30 ATE/VTE and 18 major/minor bleeds were observed in these 22 and 11 ET with complications while 6 patients had both VTE and BLEEDS during follow-up. Reduced levels of ADAMTS13 and of VWF activities correlated with the observed thrombotic and bleeding event. Conclusion: In a well characterized cohort of ET patients we could find that reduced levels of ADAMTS13 and VWF activities can be associated with their thrombotic and bleeding complications. These assays might be useful during the clinical follow-up to identify patient at risk for these complications.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,"(Federici A.B.)

WZ9NENU4,journalArticle,2017,,STUDY OF THE ADAMTS-13 LEVEL AS PREDICTIVE BIOMARKER FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS IN LIVER CIRRHOSIS,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03322696&from=export,"Brief Summary Patients with cirrhosis of viral etiology (HCV/HBV); Patients with cirrhosis of any other etiology (alcohol, idiopatic, autoimmune). Planned Number of cirrhotic subjects 200 patients Inclusion Criteria Subjects (18 yr old) with liver cirrhosis of any etiology, Exclusion Criteria All patients should not have hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignant tumors, they should not be treated with anticoagulant / antiplatelet agents, not affected by PVT already diagnosed and not suffering from congenital coagulation disorders (haemophilia A / B, von disease Willebrand, another congenital deficiency of coagulation factors) or severe thrombocytopenia (\<30,000 Plt / μL). Subject has participated in another clinical study within 30 days prior to study enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study on cirrhosis Primary Objective To describe the prospective modification of ADAMTS-13 level and other coagulation variables (e.g. FVIII, VWF:Ag/VWF:act) in cirrhotic patients during 18 months from the enrolment and to verify their predictive role as biomarker of development of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) Secondary Objectives To describe prospectively the modification of ADAMTS-13 level as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis Statistical analysis The total duration of the study will be of 12 months. The sample size of 200 subjects will be selected as a feasible number of patients to be recruited in a period of six months. The patients will be consecutively enrolled and followed for 18 months. As a result, in a follow up period of 18 months about 20-25 cases of PVT are expected. Continuous variables will be expressed as means ± standard deviations. In addition to descriptive statistics (location parameters), univariate analysis will be performed on each parameter and development of PVT during the follow up period. In previous observational studies both 1) a reduced PV flow \[prospectively\] and 2) a reduction of ADAMTS-13 are significantly associated with PVT. These associations will be investigated prospectively and analyzed simultaneously by a multivariate analysis and ROC curve to establish the sensitivity and specificity of these parameters as predictors of PVT development. Analyses will be performed using available data Detailed Description BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The occurrence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) radically changes the prognosis of cirrhotic patients, particularly those awaiting liver transplantation. If this happens, it occurs in about 8-10% / year in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation. Some studies have suggested the involvement of various risk factors for the development of PVT in cirrhotic patients, including the classic congenital and acquired thrombophilic conditions \[1-6\], although contributions of our research group have shown that a key element in the development of PVT in these patients is the decreased velocity of portal blood flow \[7, 8\]. The possible contribution of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and ADAMTS-13, produced by the liver stellate cells \[9\], for the development of PVT is rather poorly documented. In a recent observational study of the proponent \[10\], conducted on 84 patients with liver cirrhosis, it was found that the level of circulating ADAMTS-13 is significantly lower in the group with PVT (median = 16.8% vs. 69.1%, p = 0.0047) and independently associated with the presence of portal thrombosis (p = 0.007). However, given the non-longitudinal nature of the study, it is possible that the decreased level of ADAMTS-13 observed is the consequence and not the cause of PVT. It is also yet to investigate the association of ADAMTS-13 level with the specific etiology of cirrhosis (viral, alcoholic, idiopathic, etc.) and the resulting inflammation during the course of the disease. Duration of Study Period(s) and Subject Participation Two hundred (200) patients, consecutively enrolled in a period of about 6 months, will be followed for 18 months from the enrolment. As a result, in the subsequent 18 months about 20-25 cases of PVT will be expected. All patients will sign an informed consent. The severity of liver function failure will be assessed using the Child-Pugh score \[11\]. Primary Endpoint To describe in a prospective way the association of both basal ADAMTS-13 level and portal vein flow with development of PVT in cirrhotic patients during 18 months from the enrolment. Secondary Endpoints To describe prospectively the modification of ADAMTS-13 level as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis Coagulation and biochemical parameters The prospective study will measure the following biochemical and coagulation parameters at each follow-up visit, scheduled at interval of 4 months according to routine controls: Coagulation and thrombophilia factors All blood samples will be drawn under fasting conditions in the morning. Determinations of PT, APTT, fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C, protein S, lupus anticoagulant, FVIII (two-stage chromogenic assay) and D-dimer will be carried out on an automatic coagulometer (ACL Top 700, IL). VWF-antigen VWF:activity will be measured in plasma samples by chemiluminescence assays. VWF multimer (VWFm) pattern was measured as previously reported \[10\]. FV Leiden R506Q and prothrombin G20210A genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed by using commercial kits based on PCR-RT-based method (from EliTechGroup S.p.A., Torino, Italy) on an automatic instrument (Model 7300, Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Measurement of ADAMTS-13 activity. ADAMTS-13 activity was measured in citrated plasma samples by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay using a VWF86 amino-acid peptide substrate contained in a commercial kit from Instrumentation Laboratory (ADAMTS-13 activity, Werfen Group, Milano, Italy) and a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorometer, as previously detailed \[10, 13\] and expressed as % of normal plasma. Clinical Chemistry assays. All clinical chemistry assays (plasma albumin, creatinine, alanine-leucine-amino-transferase (ALT) and total bilirubin) will be performed as a part of routine diagnostic work-up within 24 hours of clinical observation in the central laboratory of the ""A. Gemelli"" Hospital, using heparinized plasma samples and commercial reagents from Siemens. Secondary objectives. The secondary objectives of analyzing the levels of ADAMTS-13 and VWF as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis will be further assessed only after a certified diagnosis of the particular etiologic of cirrhosis. In the case of HCV-associated cirrhosis also the genotype of HCV will be analyzed. Informed Consent and Enrollment Any patient who will provide informed consent (i.e., signs and dates the informed consent form and assent form, if applicable) and will meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered enrolled in the study. Subject Identification Code. The following series of numbers will comprise the subject identification code (SIC): protocol acronym (ADAPTHRO), and 2-digit subject number (e.g., 01....02) reflecting the order of enrollment (i.e., signing the informed consent form). For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form will be identified as ADAPTHRO-03. All study documents (e.g., CRFs, clinical documentation, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. Subject Completion/Discontinuation A subject is considered to have completed the study when he/she ceases active participation in the study because the subject has, or is presumed to have, completed the study according to the protocol, participated for the specified observational time and when the study exit form has been completed. Reasons for completion/discontinuation will be reported on the Completion/ Discontinuation CRF page, including: completed, screen failure, adverse event (e.g., death), discontinuation by subject (e.g., lost to follow-up \[defined as 3 documented unsuccessful attempts to contact the subject\], dropout), physician decision (e.g., pregnancy, progressive disease, protocol violation(s)), Vital Signs Vital signs will include height (cm) and weight (kg). Height and weight will be collected, if available, at screening visit, each annual interval visit, and study completion/termination. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Planned Statistical Analysis Continuous variables will be expressed as means ± standard deviations. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Fisher's exact tests and/or Chi-Square tests will be mainly used to compare qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative unpaired data. A p-value \< 0.05 will be considered statistically significant in an exploratory sense. In addition to descriptive statistics (location parameters), and univariate analysis, multivariate analyses are planned. Independent variables that will be found associated with PVT in univariate analysis with p\<0.05 will be used as independent covariates associated with PVT in the next 18 months in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. A two-sided p \<0.05 was defined as statistically significant. Analyses will be performed using SPSS software (version 21, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). Informed Consent. Investigators will choose patients for enrollment based on the study eligibility criteria.The investigator will exercise no selectivity so that no bias is introduced from this source. All patients must sign an informed consent form before entering into the study according to applicable regulatory requirements. Before use, the informed consent form will be reviewed by the EC. By signing the informed consent form, patients agree to take part in the study. Confidentiality Policy The investigator will comply with the confidentiality policy as described in the Non- Interventional Trial Agreement. Study Documents and Case Report Forms The investigator will maintain complete and accurate study documentation in a separate file. Documentation may include medical records, records detailing the progress of the study for each subject, signed informed consent forms, correspondence with the EC, enrollment and screening information, CRFs and laboratory reports. The investigator will comply with the procedures for data recording and reporting. Document and Data Retention The investigator will retain study documentation and data in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the document and data retention policy, as described in the Non-Interventional Study Agreement.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,,,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03322696,,alanine; alcohol; alcoholism; amino acid; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; bilirubin; biological marker; blood clotting; blood clotting disorder; blood clotting factor; blood sampling; case report; chemoluminescence; chi square distribution; Child Pugh score; clinical trial; coagulometer; controlled study; corticotropin releasing factor; creatinine; D dimer; data analysis software; diagnosis; exercise; fasting; fibrinogen; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; follow up; genotype; genotyping; hemophilia A; hepatic stellate cell; Hepatitis C virus; human; inflammation; informed consent; intervention study; Italy; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver failure; liver transplantation; lupus anticoagulant; major clinical study; multivariate analysis; observational study; polymer; portal vein blood flow; portal vein thrombosis; pregnancy; prospective study; protein C; protein S; prothrombin; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; thrombocytopenia; thromboelastograph; thrombophilia; treatment planning software; univariate analysis; vital sign; von Willebrand factor; von Willebrand factor cleaving proteinase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the role of the complex ADAMTS13/VWF in thrombosis and bleeds, 67 patients with ET diagnosed according to WHO criteria have been observed prospectively for thrombotic and bleeding events during a 36-month follow-up. Patients enrolled (n=67) were exposed to the diagnostic tests needed to characterize ET but signed an informed consent for these ADAMTS13/VWF evaluations. VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag) activities were measured by the automatic ACL-TOP systems while ADAMTS-13 was tested by TECH-NOZYM activity ELISA. These data were expressed versus International Standard in IU/dL. The VWF:RCo/Ag ratios were calculated as surrogate marker for the loss of the HMW-VWF multimers but such VWF defect were also confirmed using agarose-gel electrophoresis. Statistical analyses among the cases with or without complications were performed by SPSS. Thrombotic [ATE(7), VTE(10)] and bleeding [Menorrhagia(4), Epistaxis(4), Gastrointestinal(2)] complications were observed in 17/67(25%) ET-T and 10/67(15%) ET-B cases respectively while 40/67(60%) ET patients did show no thrombotic/bleeding events (ET-NTB). The clinical-lab data [median(range) of ET-T or ET-B were compared with those found in ET-NTB. Age, sex, JAK2 allele burden and white cell counts were not different (p=0.18) among the 3 groups. In ET-T(n=17), VWF:ACT(U/dL) was higher [162(96-209)] than that of ET-NTB[109(76-239)] with ADAMTS13(U/dL) lower [65(41-142)] than that of ET-NTB [87(56-164)]with p<0.05.

In ET-B, there was also a loss of the HMW-VWF multimers assessed by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis in most cases as predicted by VWF:ACT/Ag ratios <0.6. ADAMTS13 levels [85(50-154) were not different from ET-NTB. Based on these results from a relatively small number but well characterized patients, we can suggest that the ADAMTS13/VWF complex might be considered an additional risk factor to predict thrombotic or bleeding events in ET.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,63,,"(Di Bartolo O.; Agnoli S.; Bianchi C.; Intini D.; Lattuada A.; Carraro M.C.; Federici A.B.)

The possibility of real time audits is impractical due to the unpredictability of these events. A search of the internet found an example from New Zealand for post process evaluation. This was shared with a team as a starting point and then adjusted for system specific priorities. To start the audit, the initiation of the MTP needed to be determined as events are often started as a verbal request but then followed up with either downtime or computer orders. Study Design/Method: The Transfusion Service (TS) was determined to be the source of truth for all of the MTP events. A tracking sheet was created to capture the patient demographics, start and stop time, number and type of products issued and wastage. This was then passed onto nursing quality staff that used the tracking form and the patient chart to enter an event into the error management data base as a focused event. The focused event was built to include patient demographics and other information from the tracking form as well as where the event was called (Surgery (OR), Emergency (ED), Labor and Delivery (L&D), etc.), type of event, use of tranexamic acid (TXA), calcium chloride (CaCl), temperature monitoring and pre/ post lab results. A trial was started and 3 months of data were evaluated that contained 29 events. Results/Finding: There was an equal number of events that were initiated in the ED and the OR (12). Male patients were involved 69% of the time and 31% of time the patients expired. Trauma of some type was the majority of the cause but 13.8% of the cases involved GI Bleed and only 6.9% were obstetric cases (see chart). The lowest hemoglobin (Hgb) was found to average 7.1 with the post Hgb average of 9.7. Ratios of 1:1 for Red Blood Cells (RBC) to plasma as well as RBC to Platelets (PLT) and Cryoprecipitate (CRYO) were also determined with a target of 4:1. It was found that the RBC: plasma was 1.9:1, RBC: PLT was 5.9:1 and RBC to CRYO was 7.4:1. Use of TXA was only 24.1% and CaCl was utilized in 58.6% of cases. Conclusion: Although this data is for a short period of time it has pointed out several opportunities for improvement. The use of MTP in GI cases was not previously understood but opens up a new group of people for which education and understanding of the MTP process is needed. The low use of TXA needs to be evaluated and already has started conversations about how this drug should be stored and accessed for the MTP process. The product ratio numbers were suspected of being off but now that data is available, it is much easier to speak to this issue and look for improvement. The process will now be expanded to the Level II trauma sites in the system and routine evaluation will be shared with all sites.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,247A,,"(Aronson C.A.)

ACL reconstruction is a commonly used treatment method, but researches on 1/2 peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft are rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of removing the autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT under arthroscopy for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: 106 patients with complete ACL rupture in the Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southwest Medical University from December 2010 to December 2014 were enrolled, and autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT was removed under arthroscopy for ACL reconstruction. At baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, the knee stability was evaluated manually through the anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test, and the knee function was evaluated by Tegner activity scale, Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test tests were negative in all patients. In terms of Tegner activity scale, Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores, there were significant differences at baseline and postoperative 3 months as compared with postoperative 6 months (P < 0.05); the scores at baseline and postoperative 3 months showed significant differences compared with 12 months postoperatively (P < 0.05); the scores showed no significant difference between 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P > 0.05). These results indicate that autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT is a good choice for ACL reconstruction under arthroscopy, achieving rapid and satisfactory functional recovery of the knee joint, which is not only minimally invasive and easy to operate, but also exhibits good therapeutic efficacy.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,3815-3821,,24,21,,Chin.

Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T1ρ and T2 mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated. Noyes Score (NS) clinical grades of cartilage lesions were noted at both times and correlated with relaxation times. Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T1ρ times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T1ρ increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T1ρ and T2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UTε). RESULTS: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UTϵ. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UTϵ was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. CONCLUSION: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UTϵ and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,701-707,,3,45,,Am J Sports Med,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546516671944,,allograft; allotransplantation; anatomy and histology; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; hamstring tendon; human; physiology; procedures; tendon; tensile strength; transplantation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. PURPOSE: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. RESULTS: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0° in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35° anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35° anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40° proximally in the coronal plane and 20° to 40° anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40° proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20° proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0° in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CONCLUSION: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35° anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40° proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20° proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0° in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch.

It was hypothesized that cutting of the iliotibial band (ITB), anterolateral ligament and lateral capsule (ALL/LC), the posterior oblique ligament (POL), and the posteromedial capsule (PMC) would significantly increase internal rotation and that the anteromedial capsule (AMC), and the popliteus tendon and popliteofibular ligament (PLT/PFL) when sectioned would lead to a significant increase in external rotation of the knee. Methods: Ten pairs (n = 20) of cadaveric knees were assigned to two sequential cutting groups (posterolateral-toposteromedial and posteromedial-to-posterolateral). Specimen were subjected to 5 N-m of internal and external rotation torque at knee flexion angles 0° through 90° in the intact and after each cut state. Rotational changes were measured and compared to the intact and previous states following each cut. Results: Sectioning of the ITB significantly increased internal rotation at 60° and 90° by 5.4° and 6.2[[Unsupported Character - Codename φ]]°, respectively (after ALL/LC cut) and 3.5° and 3.8° (prior to ALL/LC cut) (Figure 1). At 60° and 90°, section of the ALL/LC produced significant increases in internal rotation of 3.1[[Unsupported Character - Codename φ]]° and 3.5°, respectively (after ITB cut) and of 0.5° (prior to ITB cut) (Figure 1). At 0°, section of the POL produced significant increases in internal rotation of 2.0° (ITB intact) and 1.8° (after ITB cut) (Figure 1). Sectioning the PLT/PFL complex significantly increased external rotation at 60° and 90° by 2.7° and 2.9°, respectively (prior to sectioning medial structures) and 2.2° and 2.7[[Unsupported Character - Codename φ]]°, respectively (after sectioning medial structures) (Figure 2). Sectioning the AMC produced significant increases in external rotation at 30°- 90° of flexion, however the magnitude of change was < 1° (Figure 2). Conclusion: Collectively the anterolateral corner structures had a primary role in internal rotational control of the knee from 60° to 90° of knee flexion. The ITB was the most significant primary stabilizer for internal rotation in ACL intact knees. The POL contributed to internal rotational control at full extension, while the PLT/PFL complex controlled external rotation of the knee at higher flexion angles (60° and 90°). Internal rotation control of the knee has been mainly attributed to the cruciate and collateral ligaments. This study delineates the primary and secondary roles of the ITB, the ALL/LC, POL and PLT/PFL to rotatory stability of the knee. As such, it provides new information about the understanding of rotational instabilities of the knee. (Figure Presented).",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,3,5,,Orthop. J.

Methods: Achilles, quadriceps, semitendinosus + gracilis (STG), tibialis anterior (TA) and the peroneus longus (PL) were harvested from 30 donors. Group A contained 50 tendons without gamma irradiation. The groups were irradiated with a dose of 21 kGy (group B 50 tendons) and with a dose of 42 kGy (group C 50 tendons). The grafts were soaked in a radio-protectant solution and frozen at −80 °C. Cyclic loading tests were performed followed by load to failure tests. Young modulus of elasticity, maximum force, strain at tensile strength and strain at rupture were calculated. Results: The Achilles tendons had significantly lower Young modulus than the TA (p = 0.0036) in group A. The Achilles showed significantly lower than PL (p = 0.000042) and TA (p = 0.00142) in group B and C. The quadriceps and the ST (p = 0.0037) provided poorer values than the TA (p = 0.0432) in group C. We found no difference in maximum loads among the tendons in group A. The maximum load of the Achilles and quadriceps showed better results than the PL (p = 0.0016), (p = 0.0018) and the STG (p = 0.0066), (p = 0.0019) in group C. The TA had similar results like the Achilles and quadriceps.

According to data in the general population, the incidence rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury was 1:3500. The treatment option of ACL injury cases include physical exercise and reconstruction surgery. Graft options for the ACL reconstruction include:autograft and allograft. One of the most popular autograft is hamstring. The use of hamstrings in ACL reconstruction still arguing among the expert. The choice of autograft that can be chosen as a new alternative is the peroneus longus tendon. Currently, there is very few biomechanical study on peroneus longus strength as an alternative choice of autograft in ACL reconstruction. The study to determine the tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon was conducted by the researcher as a preliminary study that could bring new perspective for future studies. Materials and methods This is an experimental research. Six human cadaveric specimens as research material. Each cadaver was treated by taking hamstring and peroneus from both lower limbs. The hamstring and peroneal tendons were then measured by applying the Hydraulic Servo Pulser tensile test apparatus. Data on tensile strength comparison between peroneal tendon and hamstring were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. Result From the measurement results, it is known that hamstring has lower average tensile strength value compared to peroneus without significant difference (p > 0.05). Conclusion The tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon, which is similar to that of hamstring, gives information that both have the same biomechanic properties. Peroneus longus should not be used as a first option in ACL reconstruction, but may be used as an alternative donor in cases involving multiple instability that require more tendon donors in the reconstruction.",2017,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,41-44,,"(Rudy, rudy_medstud@yahoo.com) Orthopaedic and Traumatology, Faculty of Medicine Brawijaya University, Saiful Anwar General Hospital Malang, Indonesia",9,,Intl.

These adaptations are often done automatically, like varying the walking movement while passing different surface conditions (e.g. smooth-rough, soft hard) or also a cross-sloped surface. Therefore we anticipate our muscular activation pattern with a slightly alternation to accomplish the movement task in an appropriated way, that may increase safety or performance. The goal of this study was to analyse the anticipated muscular activity and the inter-muscular synchronization while walking barefoot on flat and cross-sloped surface within each and overall subjects. Research question: Is there a temporal shift in the muscular synchronisation while walking on flat or cross-sloped surface? Methods: A 3D-gait-analysis (Vicon, 12 Cameras T20) with a synchronous surface electromyogram (EMG) (Myon, 2400 Hz) of the right leg muscles: Tibialis anterior (TA), Peroneus longus (PL), Gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL), Vastus medialis (VM) and lateralis (VL), Rectus femoris (RF), Semitendinosus (ST) and Biceps femoris (BF) was done. 10 subjects (f, 22-25y) walked at a self-selected speed on flat and cross-sloped surface (6°). 10 trials of each condition and surface were measured: flat, cross-slope upside- leg, cross-slope down-side-leg. The time was normalised over a gait-cycle, the averaged kinematic data and the normalized Wavelet-Transformed-EMG Total-Intensity (Itot) of the wavelets 5 to 8 with the centre frequencies: 92; 128; 170 and 218 Hz were analysed within a gait cycle for each subject and overall subjects while walking on the different conditions. Results: The results show a significant difference in the stancephase for the knee flexion and ankle dorsi-flexion between the conditions flat and cross-slope down-side-leg as well as for crossslope up-side-leg and down-side-leg for all 10 subjects. The overall mid-stance muscular adaption of one representative subject show e.g. on the flat surface is the GM-ItotMAX 2.4% before the GL-ItotMAX, while for the cross-slope up-side-leg condition GM-ItotMAX is 0.3% ahead of the GL-ItotMAX. The results overall subjects show that GM-I ItotMAX is significant earlier than GM-I ItotMAX: 1.8% (SD: 1.6%, p: 0.016) on the flat surface and 3% (SD: 2.4%, p: 0.016) for the cross-slope down-side leg. There is no significance shift for the cross-slope up-side-leg with 2% (SD: 2.5%, p: 0.081) between GM-I ItotMAX and GM-I ItotMAX. The intramuscular temporal shifts between the 3 conditions are for the GM-I ItotMAX in the cross-slope up-sideleg 1.3% (SD: 2.5%, p: 0.26) and down-side-leg 1.7% (SD: 2.8%, p: 0.19) earlier than on flat surface, and the GL-ItotMAX is in the upside- leg 1.1% (SD: 2.0%, p: 0.91) and the down-side-leg 0.5% (SD: 1.9% p: 0.41) earlier than on the flat surface. Discussion: The results show that the movement, even with small changes in the surface condition lead to a detectable in the kinematic and muscular activation pattern. The variation in the surface requires also a new synchronisation pattern of the muscular interplay similar as Wakeling [1] showed with the muscle tuning by varying the shoe elasticity. These optimising processes may be performed by a feed-forward controlling system and can there fore be seenas an anticipated muscular synchronization. This is necessary in adjusting our neuromuscular activity pattern in daily movement tasks. Further, the measured time shifts of the ItotMAX between the 3 conditions were small. A range of 1% corresponds to about 8 to 10 ms for the measured gait-cycle time of approximate 0.8-1 s. Although it is known that small neuromuscular changes may lead e.g. to Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome due to a delayed onset of the VM vs. VL [2,3], or increase the risk of ACL-Ruptures [4] due to a different muscular activation pattern of the ST. However neuromuscular training may increase the ability in anticipated muscular synchronization, which reduces the risk of injuries dramatically [5,6] and increases the performance in sport [7]. Therefore the anticipated muscular synchronization is an important aspect of neuromotor control in daily activities.",2016,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,61,,"(Estermann A.S.; Nösberger L.)

Design: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1ρ and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1ρ or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1ρ or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. Results: Higher baseline SSD T1ρ posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1ρ pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year.

A matched-pair analysis was performed by matching patients in each group by gender and by age at the time of surgery within three years. Paired t-tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. Results: Twenty matched-pairs were formed, including nine males and eleven females in each group. Average age at surgery was 34 years (range, 13-57 years). Average follow-up was 3.3 years. No significant differences were found in any of the KOOS subscale scores, Subjective IKDC (A: 75, H: 77), SANE (A: 86, H: 90), SF-12 Physical (A: 53, H: 53) or Mental (A: 53, H: 52) component scores, or activity level prior to injury (A: 7.5, H: 7.4) or at time of follow-up (A: 6.7, H: 6.2). Conclusion: Patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction with a hybrid graft (hamstring autograft plus allograft) have similar subjective outcomes to those with a hamstring autograft. Further studies are needed to determine patient characteristics which favor the use of hybrid grafts.",2016,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,e6,,6,32,,Arthroscopy J. Arthroscopic Relat.

This deterioration of cartilage can be monitored using quantitative MR, specifically T1ρ and T2. Immediately following injury, elevated T1ρ and T2 have been found in cartilage of the posterolateral tibia (pLT); this can be interpreted as an indicator of injury severity because the pivot shift injury mechanism results in the impaction of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterolateral tibial plateau. Additionally, postural stability and isokinetic strength may be decreased despite reconstruction's partial restoration of kinematics; however, these two pathologies have not been studied concurrently. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional performance of ACL reconstructed knees at one and two years after surgery, its relationship to the severity of injury and its association with T1ρ and T2 relaxation times. Methods: 29 patients (Age= 30.8 ± 8.2 years, BMI = 23.62 ± 2.82 kg/ m2, 16 females) with acute unilateral ACL tears and no previous history of knee trauma or disease were recruited prior to surgery (i.e. baseline). Patients were scanned at baseline (BL), 1 year (1Y) and 2 year (2Y) follow-ups using a 3T MR scanner to acquire sagittal high resolution 3D fast spin-echo imaging (CUBE) and T1ρ and T2 sequences. Cartilage was segmented semi-automatically on CUBE images into six compartments [lateral femoral condyle, lateral tibia, medial femoral condyle, medial tibia, trochlea and patella], and further divided into 14 subcompartments. Functional performance was evaluated using the commercially available Y-Balance Test (YBT), single leg hop test for distance (SHD) and timed 6-meter hop test for both injured and contralateral (contra) knees. Performance values were obtained by averaging three trials for each assessment. Paired t-test was used to compare functional performance of injured and contra sides at 1Y and 2Y, and also to compare between 1Y and 2Y. Partial correlations controlling for age, gender, BMI and leg length determined whether BL T1ρ and T2 in the pLT, interpreted as an indicator of severity of injury, predicts functional performance at 2Y. Partial correlations were also used to determine cross-sectional correlations between functional performance and T1ρ and T2, and also to evaluate if functional performance at 1Y longitudinally affected T1ρ and T2 at 2Y. Significance was defined as p<0.05. Results: There was no significant difference in YBT performance between injured and contra sides at 1Y and 2Y, as well as between 1Y and 2Y. SHD on the injured side was significantly lower than contra at 1Y and 2Y (Figure 1A) (p<0.01). Timed 6-meter hop was significantly slower for the injured knee at 1Y (p<0.01), but not at 2Y (Figure 1B). No significant associations were identified between 2Y T1ρ and T2 with YBT, SHD, or timed 6-meter hop at 2Y or 1Y. Higher T1ρ and T2 in the pLT of the injured knee at BL was associated with decreased YBT distance in all three directions of both knees (Figure 2) (p<0.05, R=-0.427). There was no association between 1Y functional performance with 2Y T1ρ or T2. Conclusions: The lack of significance between injured and contra 1Y and 2Y YBT performance suggests recovery of postural stability; however, the injured sides' significantly decreased SHD at 1Y and 2Y and slower 6-meter hop at 1Y may be due to deficiency in strength and confidence in the affected limb. Although there is no significant difference between injured and contra sides of YBT as a group, there are individual variations, and BL T1ρ and T2 in pLT was correlated with YBT at 2Y. Because the pLT is a region of cartilage damaged by the pivoting mechanism during initial injury, the negative correlation between BL T1ρ and T2 in the pLT and YBT performance suggests that injury severity may affect postural stability at 2Y; this altered function may suggest abnormal kinematics in the knee joint and lead to long-term OA. Interestingly, we found similar correlations between T1ρ and T2 and YBT in the contra side as well, suggesting potential adaption of the uninjured side. Our next steps include using additional 2Y follow-ups to further assess long-term functional performance's relationship with BL T1p and T2, as well as its relationship with biomechanical data and patient report outcomes.

We tested the tendon grafts with five different types of fixation devices: surgical thread (Premicron 3), general mounting clamp, wire mesh, cement fixation, and a modified clamp for an INSTRON loading machine. The mean failure load in case of surgical thread fixation was (381N ± 26N). The results with the general clamp were (527N ± 45N).

Human allografts are often oedematous, compounding this issue in the context of multi-ligament reconstructions. Tunnel upsizing reduces bone stock, increases the complexity of multi-bundle surgery and may compromise graft-osseous integration if cortical suspensory fixation is used. Graft compression provides uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel, potentially improving the 'press-fit' graft-osseous interaction whilst preserving bone stock. To our knowledge, no biomechanical evaluation of this increasing popular technique has been reported. Hypotheses: Graft compression would not cause any significant changes in the biomechanical properties of human allograft tendon that would be detrimental to the function of an ACL reconstruction. Compressed Bioclense® allograft will increase in size when soaked in Ringer's solution at 36° improving the 'press-fit' within the bone socket, decreasing micro-motion at the graft-osseous interface following ACL reconstruction. Method: In-vitro laboratory study. Sixteen samples of Bioclense® treated peroneus longus allograft were quadrupled into GraftLink constructs randomly divided into control and compressed groups. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined using alginate moulds and specimens immersed, under tension, in Ringer's solution at 36.5°. CSA was measured at 8 hours. A further 32 samples were randomised and evaluated under cyclic loading of 70N-220N (1020 cycles) followed by test to failure. A further 30 samples were quadrupled into GraftLink constructs and mounted within porcine femurs using suspensory fixation. High resolution videometer recorded motion at the graft-osseous interface under the same cyclic loading protocol. An independent samples t-test was used to compare changes in CSA whilst a one-way ANOVA was used for biomechanical end points. Results: CSA increased by 1.2 ± 0.04% and 16 ± 0.07% in control and compressed groups during joint simulation (P<0.05). Cyclic creep was 0.62 ± 1.22mm and 1.75 ± 0.97 (P>0.05), the Young's moduli were 617 ± 172 MPa and 708 ± 219 MPa (P>0.05) and ultimate tensile strength 85.2 ± 27.4 MPa and 89 ± 25.3 MPa (P>0.05) for the control and compressed groups respectively. Initial samples (n=4) show amplitude of cyclic motion of control and compressed ACL grafts in situ were 2.1mm (±0.6) and 1.9mm (±0.7) for control and compressed groups respectively. Conclusions: The process of graft compression does not have any detrimental effects upon Bioclense® treated allograft tendons. Following graft compression, these tendons significantly increase in size during intra-articular simulation promoting a 'press-fit' within the bone socket. Graft compression may significantly decrease micromotion at the graft-osseous interface with further testing.",2016,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,2,4,,Orthop. J.

All thrombotic PAPS were on warfarin with regular INR monitoring. During follow-up 11 PAPS deceased (D-PAPS) of recurrent thrombosis mostly arterial, despite adequate anticoagulation yielding an overall vascular mortality of 10 %. D-PAPS had the strongest baseline aPTTr and DRVVTr and the highest mean baseline IgG aCL, FNG, VWF and PLT.

METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations and 10° axial/30° coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. RESULTS: Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10° axial/30° coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20° axial/20° coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater.",2016,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,195-200,,1,24,,Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,,,,,,,,English,,,Medline,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-014-3363-0,,adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; cadaver; computer assisted tomography; female; femur; human; injury; knee; male; middle aged; procedures; surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human plasma can be obtained by plasmapheresis or recovered plasma from whole blood donation. The quality of the plasma is important for the fractionation process. Aim: To evaluate the quality of source and recovered plasma for fractionation. Materials and methods: Donors fulfilling current national and European eligibility criteria underwent whole blood donation or plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis was performed using the PCS and MCS+ (Haemonetics, Braintree, USA) as wells as the A 200 devices (Fenwal, Round Lake, USA). 500 ml whole blood was drawn into standard blood bag systems (Fresenius, Bad Homburg and Macopharma, Langen, Germany) and after centrifugation blood was processed into its components. The following quality control parameters were measured: total protein (TP) (AU 640, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), platelets, red blood cells (Neubauer chamber), white blood cells (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), and factor VIII (ACL, Instrumentation Laboratory). 10 plasma samples were pooled prior to analysing TP and F VIII. Results: The quality control data of 956 plasmapheresis units and 44 recovered plasma units are presented as mean ± SD in the table.

The AATB conducted a survey and found that 29 out of 36 tissue banks use a standard gamma radiation ranging from 1.0-3.5 Mrad7. The purpose of this study is to investigate the biomechanical properties of non-irradiated and irradiated peroneus longus (PL) and peroneus brevis (PB) tendons. The ultimate load and ultimate stress of non-irradiated and irradiated PL & PB was evaluated. Methods: Seven pairs of PL & ten pairs of PB tendons were recovered from human cadavers, with age ranging from 13-57 (mean of 41) years old. The left side of each allograft was irradiated at 1.5-2.5Mrad, while the right side was kept aseptic and non-irradiated. Allografts were stored at -80°C and thawed out 2-3 hours before testing at room temperature (23°C). The diameter of each allograft was measured with a graft sizer in a double loop fashion. Allografts were then mounted in freeze grips, with an active testing length of 4 cm, pulled in an MTS model 858 MiniBionix II in displacement control at a strain rate of 100%/sec. Failure mode was observed and recorded. From the force and displacement graph, the peak force (N) and the excursion of peak force (mm) was noted. The stiffness (N/mm) was the slope of the linear portion of the graph. From the ultimate load, the ultimate stress was calculated from dividing by the cross-sectional area. The percentage difference was calculated between each pair. The paired samples were compared using Student's t-test. Results: Peroneus Brevis. The mean ultimate load for the non-irradiated PB was 1466.2±203.1 N, while the irradiated PB was 1365.4±303.8N. The difference between the mean ultimate load for non-irradiated and irradiated PB paired, was 11.6±13.1%. The ultimate stress for the non-irradiated PB was 78.77±20.6MPa and 73.2±16.2MPa for the irradiated PB. The difference between the mean ultimate stress for the non-irradiated and irradiated PB paired was 12.0±19.1%. The elongation at peak load for the non-irradiated side was 13.2±3.13mm and 9.8±2.6mm for the irradiated side. This difference was -41.9 ± 42.1% which was the only statistically significant difference for all measures, P<0.05. This elongation amounts to 33.1% for non-irradiated PB, vs. 24.4% for irradiated PB. The structural stiffness for non-irradiated PB was 170.9±73.0N/mm and 225.8±46.0N/mm for irradiated PB. The paired difference was 23.2±34.2%. Peroneus Longus. The mean ultimate load for the non-irradiated PL was 1815.5±1075.1N and 1660.4±922.0N for the irradiated PL. The difference between the mean ultimate load for the non-irradiated and the irradiated PL was 6.9±19.0%. The mean ultimate stress for the non-irradiated PL was 93.7±15.6MPa and 89.1±18.2MPa for the irradiated PL. The difference between the mean ultimate stress for the non-irradiated and the irradiated PL paired was 2.1%. The elongation at peak load for the non-irradiated PL was 15.7± 3.6mm, and 17.3±5.1mm for the irradiated PL, for a difference of 3.2±37.2%. This elongation amounts to 39.3% for non-irradiated PL, vs. 43.4% for irradiated PL. The structural stiffness for non-irradiated PL was 203.9±67.0N/mm and 225.7±56.8N/mm for irradiated PL. The paired difference was 5.8±37.7%. Discussion: The results do not demonstrate any significant difference between irradiated and non-irradiated PB and PL tendons when exposed to 1.5-2.5Mrad of gamma irradiation. The only exception to this was the observed elongation of PB. However, this difference is probably of no clinical relevance since the elongation is well beyond the normal expected operating range of an ACL (< 10%).

However, because this technique uses suture loops and cortical suspension buttons for graft fixation, it has mostly been limited to looped graft constructs (e.g., hamstring autograft, peroneus longus allograft). Quadriceps tendon autograft offers several advantages in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but, until recently, has not been compatible with suture-loop and cortical suspensory fixation. We describe a technique that allows a relatively short (<75 mm) quadriceps tendon autograft (without bone block) to be used with established all-inside anatomic techniques.",2015,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,e841-e845,,6,4,,Arthroscopy Tech.,,,,,,,,English,,,Embase,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2015.08.004,,anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; article; fluoroscopy; GraftLink; human; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; quadriceps tendon; surgical anatomy; surgical technique; suture technique; tendon graft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. Methods: Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameter <7 mm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3 years after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Results: The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2 mm on average (range, 6.0–6.5 mm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6 mm (range, 9.5–10.0 mm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80–90).

Many publications demonstrated an increase of early development of atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatic diseases. The data have been focused on carotid arterial atherosclerotic alterations, such as intima-media thickness and plaque formation. Objectives: The aim of our study was to assess the procoagulation state and its assotiation with inflammation in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early atherosclerosis. Methods: The study included 37 female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ACR, 1987), mean age 45,0 (33,0; 51,0) years old, disease duration 9,0 (3,0; 14,0) years, disease activity (DAS28=5,37 (4,69; 5,86) points. Twenty-eight healthy women of the same age formed the control group. The levels of platelet cells (PLT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTP), fibrinogen were determined with coagulation analyser, while D-Dimer, LA, IgG/IgM antibodies to cardiolipin (aCL), β2-glycoprotein-1 (aβ2-GP1), high sensitive Creactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were determined with ELISA. The presence of carotid atherosclerotic alterations was revealed ultrasonographically according to standard procedures. Results: The patients with RA had significantly higher levels of fibrinogen, D-Dimer, LA, aCL IgG, aβ2-GP1 IgG/IgM, hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α than in the control group (Table 1). The atherosclerotic alterations were found in 48,65% patients with RA, 28,57% in the control group. We reveled positive correlation between PLT and DAS28 (r=0,626, p=0,005), aCL IgM (r=0,513, p=0,029), D-Dimer and hs-CRP (r=0,747, p=0,003), DAS28 (r=0,819, p=0,0006) in RA patients with carotid atherosclerosis, that reflects association between prothrombotic and inflammatory markers. Conclusions: We demonstrated the presence of prothrombotic state in patients with RA, who had higher levels of inflammatory markers too. Thus, we suggest that inflammation can influence the prothrombotic state in patients with RA, induce endothelial dysfunction and, as a result, early development of atherosclerosis.

Objectives: To identify mortality predictors in patients with PAPS. Methods: Record review of all PAPS patients attending the Haemostasis Unit of the Cardarelli Hospital from 1988 to 2008. We identified 11 deceased patients (5M, 6F, age 55±9 yrs), 68 surviving thrombotic PAPS (21M, 47F, 47±14 yrs) and 29 persistent carriers of antiphospholipid antibodies (PCaPL) without thrombosis (7M, 22F,tage 50±16 yrs). The following had been tested at baseline and confirmed 6 weeks later: aPTT, DRVVT, KCT and plasma fibrinogen (FNG) by coagulation assays; IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) by Elisa; platelet (PLT) count on automatic analyser. Results: IgG aCL (GPL) was 328±344 in deceased PAPS, 105±146 in surviving PAPS and 75±167 in PCaPL (p<0.0001); aPTT ratio was 2.17±0.46 in deceased PAPS, 1.92±0.65 in surviving PAPS and 1.79±1.01 in PCaPL (p<0.02); DRVVT ratio was 2.30±0.80 in deceased PAPS, 1.65±0.43 in surviving PAPS and 1.33±0.32 in PCaPL (p<0.0001); plasma FNG (mg/dl) was 385±70 in deceased PAPS, 335±49 in surviving PAPS and 312±63 in PCaPL (p<0.02); PLTs (109/L) were 293±105 in deceased PAPS, 202±86 in surviving PAPS and 141±77 in PCaPL (p<0.0001). KCT ratio and vWF concentration did not differ. Sex, disease duration, age at first thrombotic event, number of thrombotic events, IgG aCL titre, aPTTr, DRVVTr, FNG, vWF and platelet numbers were entered as independent variables in a stepwise Cox regression model with mortality as the dependent variable: DRVVTr was the single most powerful predictor of mortality that was 20% at 17 years.

Material and Method: The study included 24 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft and endobutton fixation. Results of ACL reconstruction were assessed via physical examination. Donor site morbidity of the foot and ankle after tendon-harvesting was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot-and-Ankle Society (AOFAS) for ankle-hindfoot score and Visual Analogue Score-Foot Ankle (VAS-FA). Isokinetic testing for the ankle was performed in 10 voluntary patients after surgery. Results: Mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Regarding the latest follow-up, anterior drawer tests of ankle showed normal findings in 83.3%, and 1+ anterior laxity in 16.7% of all patients. Mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS scores were 100.0 ±0.0 and 96.0±9.6, respectively at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.06). Mean pre- and postoperative VAS-FA scores were 99.7±1.1 and 95.4±12.0, respectively at ~13-month follow-up (p = 0.09). At 7-month follow-up by isokinetic testing, peak torques of eversion and inversion were significantly lower on the harvested ankle compared with the contralateral ankle at both velocities (60°/second and 120°/second, p<0.05). Conclusion: Based on overall findings in the present study, the authors could not recommend the peroneus longus tendon as the first option of donor graft for ACL reconstruction due to the several morbidities particularly in the first 12 months after the operation. However, the peroneus longus tendon may be the option after other graft harvestings for the ligament reconstruction, which needs several tendon grafts in a patient with multi-directional instability of the knee due to some specific situation such as a traumatic knee dislocation.",2015,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,555-560,,6,98,,J.

Therefore it is important to equip blood donation centres with advanced technologies meant for blood collection and processing. Then due to its specific properties plasma can be used as the main or supplementary treatment of many diseases. Aims: The study was conducted to compare the quality of plasma obtained with two systems used for blood collection in our blood establishment. The outcomes were intended to show if different systems for blood collection have a big impact on the purity of plasma as well as on preservation of protein and labile blood components. The research is planned for the next 5 years to check the quality parameters in time. Methods: The studied material was plasma before freezing produced with 2 different systems. Whole blood collected with TACSI CRC bags after 2 h of storage at room temperature was separated with TACSI WB system. In case of quadruple bags with in-line filter the blood needed additional step-it was centrifuged and then separated with T-ACE II separators. After collecting samples the quality parameters were determined. We evaluated the residual cells in plasma with FACS Calibur flow cy-tometer, total protein and albumin concentration with Konelab 60 and clotting factors and fibrinogen with ACL TOPcls300 analyzer. Results: With respect to residual cells (WBC, RBC, PLT) all studied donations of plasma were found to be compliant with quality requirements; the results differ in case of both systems (RBC count 118% higher in case of TACSI CRC, PLT count 107% greater in quadruple bags) but were still far from the maximum limit. Protein concentration was 3.3% bigger in TACSI CRC, but the level of albumin was the same in both cases. The activity of coagulation factor V and VIII was higher in case of TACSI CRC-respectively 5.6% and 2.9% difference compared with other system, but the results regarding factor IX and fibrinogen showed greater levels in quadruple bags-were 3.8% and 9.8% greater. The results are displayed in Table 1. (table present) Summary: Both TACSI CRC and quadruple bags systems are able to separate plasma from other blood components well to meet the quality criteria regarding residual blood cells. Preservation of coagulation factors is found to be sufficient in both systems and can be summarized as comparable. TACSI CRC as well as quadruple bags can be efficiently used in blood establishments to obtain plasma which is suitable for effective treatment of various disorders. Taking into account the time of procedure and space necessary for separation TACSI CRC is found to be superior.

The most frequently observed disorder in PCa patients is acute or chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The incidence of DIC complication in PCa rages from 13% to 30%, and can be presented as catastrophic bleeding or various thrombotic events. In contrast, bleeding symptoms in the setting of primary hyperfibrinolysis in this malignancy are seen in only 0.40% to 1.65% patients, usually provoked by surgical procedures. It is supposed that metastatic PCa cells produce high levels of urokinase type plasminogen activator. Laboratory diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis is based on the increase of biomarkers like D-Dimer; fibrinogen split products, plasminogen, and euglobulin lysis test (ELT). But, these tests are not specific for primary hyperfibrinolysis and they are also elevated in other pathological condition. Aims:We reported the diagnosis and treatment of a rare case of haemorrhagic syndrome caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis, which was the first clinical symptom of metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: The patient's blood was collected in vacuum tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate and lithium heparin.Thrombelastometry analysis was performed with the Rotem® analyzer. Routine coagulation test was performed with IL ELITE PRO®and ACL 300® analyzer. Results: A 64-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with large haematomas: in the right pectoral and axillary area, size 20x7 cm, right hemiabdomen size, 30x30 cm and left lumbal area, size 25x5 cm. Hematomas developed two days before hospitalization. Patient denied neither subjective symptoms nor any medication. Performed labory analises showed mild normocytic anaemia of chronic disease (Hb 108g/L, MCV 90fL, RBC 3.72x1012/L, Hct 0.331, Plt 419x109/L, WBC 9.5x109/L, Neutrophils 60%; serum iron 12,9μmol/L, ferritin 7820μ/L), highly elevated alkaline phosphatase (1390U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1740U/L) and prostate specificic antigen (above 150ng/mL). Viral test vere negative (HBs Ag, anti HCV and anti HIV). Initial coagulation testing: protrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were within the normal range (14.4s and 31.9s, respectively), as well as anti-thrombin III (86.6%), while fibrinogen level was very low (1.068 g/l) and DDimer assay result was 1122 ng/mL. Results obtained by rotation thrombelastometry have pointed on primary fibrinolysis. First line treatment for patient was combined administration of tranexamic acid (3x500 mg intravenous) and transfusion of ten units of cryoprecipitate (400 ml). Next day, fibrinolytic function measurements by rotation thrombelastometry were within the normal ranges. APTEM test wasn't registered pathological fibrinolysis. Fibrinogen level was normalized within two days (2.4 g/l). There were no newly developed hematomas. Transrectal biopsy of prostate was successfully performed without any haemorrhagic complications, revealing prostate adenocarcinoma-G3, Gleason score 9. Further examination confirmed the laboratory findings of metastatic bone disease. Afterwards, the patient was referred to the oncologist for further treatment with androgen deprivation therapy together with oral tranexamic acid. Summary and Conclusions: This case represent primary hiperfibrinolysis with bleeding diathesis as the first clinical sign of previousy undiagnosed metastatic PCa. Rotation thrombelastometry in this severe complication helps to achieve prompt and proper diagnosis.The management of hyperfibrinolysis was done within a short period of time thanks to adequate diagnostic procedure.",2014,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,776,,"(Cvetkovic Z.)

WHQY8DT7,journalArticle,2014,"Eckstein, F.; Wirth, W.; Lohmander, S.; Hudelmaier, M.; Frobell, R.",Subregional but not total plate cartilage change differ between early and late follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament rupture,Osteoarthritis and Cartilage,,1063-4584,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L71464234&from=export,"Purpose: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is associated with acute joint trauma and chronically altered joint mechanics, and with increased risk of incident radiographic knee OA. Using quantitative MRI, we have shown that the mean femorotibial cartilage thickness increases significantly in young adults after ACL rupture, and that this increase had a similar rate during the first 2 years (BL/Y2) and the subsequent 3 years (Y2/Y5). The purpose of the present study was to compare cartilage thickness change in femorotibial subregions during early (BL/Y2) and later (Y2/Y5) follow-up, using location-independent analysis and novel disease activity (i.e. subregional cartilage thickness change summary) scores. Methods: 121 young active adults with an acute ACL rupture were studied as part of the KANON RCT. Sagittal MRIs were acquired within 5 weeks of the rupture (BL), and at Y2 and at Y5. 117 participants had BL, 112 Y2 and 112 Y5 images; 107 had Y2 and Y5 images (81 men, 26 women; median age 25.6y; age range 18-36). Cartilage thickness in the medial (MFTC) and lateral (LFTC) compartment was measured after segmentation of the medial and lateral tibial (MT/LT) and weightbearing femoral (cMF, cLF) cartilage. Thickness was analyzed in 16 femorotibial subregions (8 medial, 8 lateral, 10 tibial, 6 femoral), and thickness changes in these subregions were summarized using an ordered value (OV) system: the magnitude of change in the subregion with the strongest thinning was assigned to OV1, the one with the second strongest thinning to OV2, and so forth, and the one with the strongest thickening to OV16. A total femorotibial subregional cartilage thickness change score (ThCChS) was computed by summarizing magnitudes of all subregions, independent of their direction (i.e. thickening or thinning). Further, a total femorotibial subregional cartilage thickening (ThCTkS) and thinning (ThCTnS) scorewas computed by summarizing the changes across all subregions with thickening or thinning, respectively. Comparisons between early and later follow-up was performed using paired t-tests. Results: The annualized increase in MFTC cartilage thickness from Y2/Y5 (+24 μm; 95% confidence interval [CI] 17,31 μm) was very similar to that between BL/Y2 (+25 [10,40] μm; Table 1). Two of 16 subregions (the posterior medial and lateral tibia; pMT and pLT) showed significant cartilage thinning during early follow-up that was not seen later (Table 1). OV1 (the subregion with the strongest thinning) exhibited a change of -115 μm [-130,-100] during early, and a much smaller change during later follow-up (-54 μm [-62,-47]). Similar significant differences were observed for OV 2-5 and for OV 11-16, with OV16 exhibiting much stronger thickening early (+116 μm [104,128]) than later (+69 μm [63,75]). Differences in the TCChS between early (902 μm [836;967]) and later (483 μm [452;515]) followup were striking, and so were those in ThCTkS and ThCTnS (Table 1).When dividing the cohort into tertiles of ThCChS change, no obvious difference was noted in terms of sex, age, height, weight, or body mass index (BMI) between upper and lower tertiles (data not shown). Conclusions: Substantial subregional cartilage thickness increase and decrease appear to take place simultaneously within two years after ACL rupture. These changes are not captured when cartilage thickness change is measured at total plate, compartment or joint level. The strongest subregional cartilage thinning during early follow-up colocated with acute posttraumatic bone marrrow lesions and osteochondral fractures, but varied in location between patients. OVs were therefore statistically superior in unraveling differences in cartilage thickness change between early and later follow-up. The novel structural disease activity scores of cartilage thinning (CTnS), thickening (CTkS) and total change (CChS) are highly efficient in describing the different aspects of subregional cartilage change. They may thus be important when relating structural imaging observations of cartilage change to wet biomarker analyses of cartilage turnover.

Study Design: Ex vivo mechanical testing study. Sample Population: Canine PLT segments (n=21 dogs; 42 PLT). Methods: Morphometric measurements of PLT segments were taken from computed tomography (CT) images and compared with results obtained using calipers. PLT were tested to failure at a rate of 100%length/s. Mechanical properties and failure mode were recorded. Results: PLT width and thickness (P<.001 for both) measured by calipers were significantly lower than those taken from CT images. Thirty-five (83%) specimens failed by avulsion fracture from the patella, 1 failed mid-ligament, and 6 failed by tibial fracture. Dog weight and PLT length had the strongest Pearson's r value when correlated with load at failure (r=0.73, 0.81, respectively). Conclusion: Dog weight and PLT length were the best predictors of load at failure. PLT failure load of dogs weighing >25kg were similar to those reported for the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) suggesting that the PLT may be a suitable allograft for CCL replacement. © 2013 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.",2014,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,136-141,,2,43,,Vet.

The biomechanical characteristics of tendons that are less commonly used in knee surgery (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus and medial and lateral half of Achilles tendons) were compared to those of a semitendinosus and gracilis graft harvested from the same 10 multi-organ donors. All right side tendons constituted the study group and were frozen at '80°C and thawed at room temperature 5 times. All left side tendons were frozen at '80°C and thawed at room temperature once. There were 59 tendons in the control group and 56 in the study group. The looped grafts were clamped at one side using a custom-made freeze clamp and loaded until failure on an Instron 4505 testing machine. The average ultimate failure load was not significantly different between the control and the study group (p > 0.05). The failure load of the medial tendon Achilles was the lowest in both study and control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness between the control and study group (p > 0.05). From our study, we conclude that freezing tendons at '80°C and thawing several times does not influence the maximum load, maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness. The medial half of the Achilles tendon is clearly the weakest tendon (p < 0.001). These findings show that tendon grafts can be frozen at '80°C and thawed at room temperature several times without altering their biomechanical properties. © 2013, Acta Orthopædica Belgica.",2013,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,435-443,,4,79,,Acta Orthop.

The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL. One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus longus and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. Method: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). Results: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. Conclusions: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg. As the knee joint is unstable following the use of this method, it is recommended to find a new method of ACL reconstruction to improve the function of this ligament after reconstruction. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,526-531,,6,20,,Knee,,,,,,,,English,,,Embase,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2013.07.007,,adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; clinical article; controlled study; force; gait; hamstring muscle; human; kinematics; kinetics; motion analysis system; peroneal muscle; peroneus longus muscle; priority journal; range of motion; walking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in so called substitution patterns, which can be quantified with an observational test called Test for Substitution Patterns, TSP [1,2], and deviant muscular activation patterns [3]. Here, we introduce a method to characterize relationships between substitution patterns and deviant muscular activation patterns and present preliminary findings from patients and un-injured subjects. Patients/materials and methods: Two ACL-injured patients and four un-injured subjects participated. Subjects performed body-weight altering, mini- squat, knee flexion-extension on one leg, tiptoe standing knee-flexion-extension on one leg and forward lunge [1]. Surface EMG was recorded (Mega Win ME6000) for gluteus med., biceps fem., quadriceps fem. vast. lat., tibialis ant., med. gastrocnemius and peroneus longus in right and left leg. Metronome was used for speed setting. Knee electrogoniometer was used to define start and end of movement. EMG during test movements was divided into 10 time bins for each muscle, with an 11th 'pre-bin' for anticipatory activity. Average amplitudes for each bin were plotted in a diagram. The correlation coefficient, the intercept and the slope of the regression line were calculated to compare activity in corresponding muscles. Results: In the two ACL-injured patients, muscles in the injured lower leg had a high activity also before and after movements were performed, picked up by our method and yielded characteristic and quantifiable correlations with TSP scores. In the four un-injured subjects, the method allowed a quantification of intrasubject consistency and inter-subject variation when performing a given movement. Discussion and conclusions: We present a method for EMGanalysis focused on comparing muscle activation patterns in ACL-injured patients with and without substitution patterns. Preliminary results indicate that the method allows a quantitative characterization between deviating muscle activation patterns and substitution patterns as measured by the TSP.",2013,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,S98,,"(Trulsson A.; Gummesson C.; Miller M.)

Methods: From January 2006 to December 2009, 35 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries were recruited to undergo surgical procedures. There were 30 males and 5 females with an average age of 31.8 years (range: 21 - 56). All anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions underwent arthrosocopy. All ligaments were reconstructed with peroneus longus tendon and fixed with absorb screw. The post-operative assessments included the followings; clinical evaluations, Lysholm knee score, KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale (AOFAS). Results: All cases were followed up for an average follow-up period of 15 months (range: 12 -24). The healing time was 6-15 weeks, according to the Lysholm knee score, their outcomes were excellent (n =25), good (n =6), fair (n = 3) and poor (n = 1). The average score was 97.2 (range: 60 - 100). The rate of excellent and good was 88.6%; according to the KT-3000 arthrometer evaluations, the outcomes were normal (n =28), nearly normal (n = 4), abnormal (n = 2) and poor (n = 1). Preoperatively, the average anterior displacement was 11.59 ± 1.25 mm and the average anterior displacement at final follow-up 1.76 ± 1.83 mm. The average AOFAS score was 96.3 (range: 84 - 100). Lysholm knee score and KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation had statistical differences (P < 0.05) while AOFAS score showed no difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon can be a good substitute of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. And its resection has no major influence for ankle joint.

Materials and Methods: We studied 35 patients with MRI-confirmed full thickness ACL tears, and a 40-patient control group, with no ACL injury on MRI. An 8-echo T2 relaxation sequence (Cartigram, GE Healthcare) was used to generate T2 relaxation values (T2RV) and construct T2 color maps. For each patient, a single blinded observer measured T2RV in the hyaline cartilage superficial layer on two contiguous sagittal images (one more medial, one more lateral) at five predetermined sites, within the ACL pivot shift injury zone, for total of 10 sites per knee. Predetermined sites were the lateral femoral condyle's anterior and posterior weight-bearing area (acLF and pcLF) and the lateral tibial plateau's anterior, central, and posterior zones (aLT, cLT, and pLT). Location of any subarticular bone marrow edema (BME) was also recorded. Data analysis between the two contiguous MRI images within both ACL tears and control group was performed with a matched t test. A pooled t test was used to assess statistical significance between the two groups, with significance considered at p < 0.05 level. Results: Within the ACL tear group, T2RV statistical differences were seen between the lateral and medial images in cLT (p = 0.0005), pLT (0.0340), aLT (0.0388), and pcLF (0.0462). Within the control group, only aLT (0.0146) had T2RV statistical difference. Between the ACL tear group and control group, statistical differences were seen at cLT (0.0001) and pcLF (0.0411) in the more medial MRI image and at cLT (0.0001), pcLF (0.0001), and pLT (0.0400) in the more lateral MRI image. Twenty of the 35 ACL tear patients and none of the control group had BME. Twelve patients with ACL tears had abnormal T2RV but no BME in the pivot shift zone. Conclusion: Articular cartilage injury in a cohort of patients with ACL tears has never before been demonstrated with T2 mapping. We show that articular cartilage in the ACL injury pivot shift zone demonstrates statistically significant abnormal T2RV, even in absence of overlying BME. Knowledge of the presence and extent of chondral injury with T2 mapping may be helpful in treatment planning for patients with ACL tears.",2012,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,,,5,198,,Am. J.

Methods: Twenty-four cases of combined ACL/PCL/ PMC/PLC ruptures including 7 acute cases and 17 chronic cases were reconstructed with autograft in one stage. The semitendinosus tendon and gracilis tendon from both legs in all cases, and the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon from the same leg in 10 cases were used. Simultaneous single-bundle ACL and PCL reconstruction, PMC augmentation and PLC reconstruction was performed. The patients were followed up for a minimum of two years and evaluated according to the IKDC and Lysholm rating scale. Results: All patients, except for 2 (8.3%) having 5° extension deficit, return to normal extension. All patients showed flexion deficit, with less than 5° flexion deficit in four patients (16.7%), 6° to 15° in 14 patients (58.3%), 16° to 25° in three patients (12.5%), and more than 25° in three patients (12.5%). KT-1000 examination showed that the side-to-side difference of the overall anteriorposterior laxity at 70° flexion was 0 to 2 mm in 6 patients(25%), 3 to 5 mm in 17 patients(70.8%), 6 to 10 mm in 1 patient(4.2%); the side-to-side difference of overall anterior-posterior laxity at 25° flexion was 0 to 2 mm in 4 patients(16.7%), 3 to 5 mm in 18 patients(75%), 6 to 10 mm in 2 patients(8.3%). 3 patients showed one degree medial laxity and the others were negative. 2 patients showed one degree lateral laxity and the others were negative. External rotation test showed side to side difference of less than 5° degree in 23 cases, 6° to 10° in 1 case.

A new method for this assessment was implemented in August 2009. Aims: Presentation of two case reports (one of these with an invasive procedure). Methods: Nowadays, we perform the whole blood impedance PLT aggregometry (IPA) using multiple electrodes (Multiplate®)-hirudin tubes sampling. Before this, we applied the PLT function analyzer (PFA-100®) - citrate tubes sampling. Agonists used in PFA-100®: Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and Epinephrine (EPI), each one with a Collagen (COL) membrane for evaluation of the closure time. Activators selected in Multiplate®: ADP, Thrombin receptor activating peptide 6 (TRAP), Ristocetin (RISTO), Arachidonic acid (ASPI) and COL. Other haemostasis tests were performed in citrated plasma with HemosIL® reagents by coagulometric, chromogenic and immunologic methods, in ACL TOP®. In ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid samples solid phase red cell adherence (Immucor Inc., instrumentreagent system) was applied for screening of PLT antibodies, gel column technology (DiaMed/Bio-Rad Lab, Inc.) was used for blood typing, and ABX Pentra 80 and Coulter® LH 750 for haemograms. Results: Presented in the table-von Willebrand (VW) F: antigen (Ag), VWF activity (Act), FVIII, PLT count; expressed in seconds for PFA-100® and U for Multiplate® ; normal aggregation only with low concentration of RISTO. Both patients are ORh+, had a normal PLT morphology and a negative screening of PLT antibodies. Other laboratory results were normal (including D-Dimers). Case report 1: A Caucasian woman, 68 years old, Gravida (G) 3 Para (P) 1 Abortus (A) 2, with haemorrhagic manifestations after bilateral inguinal hernioplasty in 2009/6/29. Past medical history (PMH): ecchymosis; traumatic lesion of 4th finger of the left hand highly haemorrhagic; umbilical and right inguinal herniorraphies; rectal/vesical prolapses and lumbar hernia surgeries. All invasive procedures, including dental treatments, were complicated by bleeding, except a removal of a skin lesion. Family history (FH): irrelevant. Case report 2: A Caucasian woman, 67-years-old, G6 P4 A2, submitted to a kidney transplant due to polycystic disease complicated by intraperitoneal haemorrhage in March 2004. PMH: Child birth deliveries and puerperium periods were highly haemorrhagic, menorrhagias, bleeding associated to dialysis vascular access, post-traumatic maxillary surgery, partial parathyroidectomy; a nevus removal without bleeding. FH: irrelevant. She was submitted to an endometrial biopsy by dilation and curettage in 2010/11/26. Immediately before this procedure she had a transfusion with one PLT pool and was discharged at 2010/11/27 without complications. In an evaluation performed at 2011/1/6, we confirmed a clinical and laboratory good status.(Table Presented ) Conclusions: Our resources were sufficient for screening and treatment of these patients. We consider that these cases can correspond to: (1) PLT granule disease (storage pool, secretion or synthesis); (2) Pseudo-VW Disease/PLT type of VWD or other PLT glycoprotein deficiency/dysfunction; (3) Type 2B of VW Disease.

Aim of the study. To identify mortality predictors in thrombotic patients with primary APS (PAPS). Methods: Record review of PAPS patients attending the Haemostasis Unit of the Cardarelli Hospital from 1988 to 2008. We identified 11 deceased patients (5M, 6F, age 55 ± 9 years), 68 surviving thrombotic PAPS (21M, 47F, 47 ± 14 years) and 29 non thrombotic but persistent carriers of antiphospholipid antibodies (PCaPL) (7M, 22F, age 50 ± 16 years). All deaths were vascular related and occurred while on adequate thromboprophylaxis. At baseline (and 6 weeks later) we tested aPTT, DRVVT, KCT, fibrinogen (FNG) (coagulation assays); IgG anticardiolipin (aCL), von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Elisa) and platelets (PLT) (automatic analyser). Results: IgG aCL (GPL) was 328 ± 344 in deceased PAPS 105 ± 146 in surviving PAPS and 75 ± 167 in PCaPL (P < 0.0001); aPTT was 2.17 ± 0.46 in deceased PAPS, 1.92 ± 65 in surviving PAPS and 1.79 ± 1.01 in PCaPL (P < 0.02); DRVVT was 2.30 ± 0.80 in deceased PAPS, 1.65 ± 0.43 in surviving PAPS and 1.33 ± 0.32 in PCaPL (P < 0.0001); FNG (mg/dL) was 385 ± 70 in deceased PAPS, 335 ± 49 in surviving PAPS and 312 ± 63 in PCaPL (P < 0.02); PLTs (109/L) were 293 ± 105 in deceased PAPS, 202 ± 86 in surviving PAPS and 141 ± 77 in PCaPL (P < 0.0001). KCT and VWF concentration did not differ. Sex, disease duration, age at first thrombotic event, number of thrombotic events, IgG aCL titre, aPTT, DRVVT, FNG, VWF and platelets were entered as independent variables in a stepwise Cox regression model with mortality as the dependent variable: A prolonged DRVVTr was the single most powerful predictor of mortality that was 20% at 17 years.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined as a status of mildly elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels associated with normal total or free T3 and T4 values. In general, it is an asymptomatic entity, usually diagnosed after routine screening or while exploring nonspecific clinical presentations, which has been associated with enhanced cardiovascular risk. There has been considerable controversy regarding the alterations of blood coagulation parameters in patients with SCH as both hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states have been referred. Aims. To evaluate platelet activation and coagulation disorders in patients with SCH and the influence of TSH, peripheral thyroid hormones (FT3, FT4) and thyroid autoantibodies such as thyroid antithyroglobulin (anti-TG) and antithyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) on them. Methods. A total of 24 patients with SCH (males/females: 10/14) and 24 euthyroid control subjects matched for age and gender were enrolled to the study. Platelet indices [platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW)] were measured in whole blood samples by flow cytometry method with the use of XE-5000 Sysmex (ROCHE). Coagulation parameters [prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), protein C and protein S] were measured in plasma samples using a fully automated analyser (ACL Top, ALAPIS). Serum TSH, FT3, FT4, anti-TG and anti- TPO levels were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with Elecsys Modular E170 analyser (ROCHE). (Table presented) Results: The results are presented in Table 1.The levels of MPV and PDW were significantly higher in the SCH group than in the euthyroidic one (p<0,05). No differences were observed in other coagulation parameters between SCH patients and control subjects. The above indices were not found to be correlated neither with the thyroid hormone concentrations nor with the measured autoantibodies levels. Summary/conclusions: Subclinical hypothyroidic patients present alterations in some blood coagulation parameters, which are indicative of platelet activation. The speculation that elevated MPV values may be involved in the increased risk of atherothrombotic complications in subclinical hypothyroidism should be further investigated.",2011,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,669,,"(Kanonidou C.; Lazaridou D.; Arampatzi S.; Nikolaidou A.; Diza E.)

The presence of activated platelets, subclinical inflammation and consequent activation of the vascular endothelium are important contributors that lead to coagulation activation. Large platelets are more active and more thrombogenic than smaller ones. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) is an index of reticulated platelets which are newly released platelets, larger and more reactive than mature ones. Increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) have been connected to morbidity and cardiovascular mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Evidence of vascular endothelial damage, includes levels of plasma von Willebrand (vWf) factor. However, relationships between these factors in cardiovascular disease are unknown. Aims: The purpose of our study was the evaluation of the levels of IPF, MPV, PDW and vWf in patients with coronary artery disease . Methods: Our material consisted of 80 patients, (47 males and 33 females, aged 18-74 years old) suffering of coronary artery disease. A second group consisted of 40 normal controls (20 males and 20 females matched for age and ethnicity). Platelet count (PLT), IPF, MPV and PDW were measured by flow cytometry with the SYSMEX XE2100, when vWf was measured using the automated analyser ACL Top (ALAPIS). Exclusion criteria for entry into the study was the presence of co-existing thrombotic or hematological disease . Results: Mean values of PLT, IPF and MPV of patients presented statistically significant difference (all p<0,05) with that of the normal controls while mean value of PDW was not significantly different. Positive correlation was found between the values of IPF and MPV (r= 0,638, p<0,01). Von Willebrand factor was significantly higher in patients compared to the normal controls (p<0,001) and was also positively correlated with IPF (r= 0,648, p<0,01). Conclusions: Patients with coronary artery disease present abnormalities in their platelets. These patients present more numerous platelets, which are bigger and activated. In this disease activated platelets and activation of the vascular endothelium, may lead to coagulation activation.",2011,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,670,,"(Arampatzi S.; Kanonidou C.; Nicolaidou A.; Lazaridou D.; Diza E.)

Methods: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bonepatellar tendonbone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. Results: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). Conclusions: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N).

Remaining leukocytes and platelets pose an immunological risk to the recipient. Those residual cells can be removed by filtration and pathogens can be inactivated with the Intercept Blood System by adding amotosalen followed by UVA-illumination. Objectives: The aim of our study was to improve the safety of FFP by filtration with the Plasmaflex PLAS 4 filter and subsequent pathogen inactivation (PI) while maintaining plasma quality according to the national guidelines. Material and methods: Plasmapheresis was performed using the Baxter Autopheresis-C and Haemonetics MCS+ machine resulting in a volume of up to 650 ml. Plasma components were kept at room temperature until further processing. We reduced the residual cells of the apheresis plasma with the Plasmaflex PLAS4 filter (Macopharma) to achieve a practically cell free product. Afterwards the plasma was pathogen inactivated with the INTERCEPT Blood System within 5 h after collection. Amotosalen was depleted with a compound adsorption device (CAD) and the plasma was split into 3 units of about 200 ml to be frozen. By using a specific validation protocol, several in-vitro parameters were tested (WBC and RBC: counting chamber; PLT: cell counter; coagulation factors: ACL Top Instrumentation Laboratory). Results: The plasma products were virtually cell free after filtration. Plasma coagulation recovery in PI-FFP was 76% regarding Factor VIII with an average content of 84%, 96% regarding Factor XI with an average content of 99%, Factor V remained unchanged. The averaged FFP loss was 24 ml. Amotosalen-concentration reduced from initial 145 μM before illumination to 91 lM after illumination and 0.94 μM after CAD. (Table Presented). Conclusion: We were able to produce a new plasma product which meets all criteria of the national guidelines with enhanced safety. No quarantine storage is needed for PI-FFP before releasing the products to the clinic.

METHODS: ACL reconstructions with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone were performed in 18 patients (18 knees)in the study from March 2007 to July 2009. Among the patients,14 patients were male and 4 patients were female, ranging in age from 21 to 47 years, with an average of 35.5 years. Twelve patients had the injuries in the right knee and 6 patients in the left knee. The CT scans were taken in a consistent manner at the 1st week and the 3rd, 6th, 12th months after surgery to measure tibial and femoral tunnel expansion. RESULTS: Tunnel enlargement didn't happen in 18 knees. The average enlargement of 18 cases of femoral tunnel was (1.10 +/- 0.42) mm; and the average enlargement of 18 cases of tibial tunnel was (1.00 +/- 0.51) mm. There was statistical significance of femoral tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); and there were no significant difference of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and the 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the peroneus longus tendon used the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has a regeneration potential or not. Twelve patients, who had originally undergone harvesting of the peroneus longus tendon for the primary surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The average age of the patients was 31 years. There were eight right and four left legs. The average time interval was 52 months between ligament surgery and MRI. In all patients, a varying amount of the regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon was seen on the MRI images. Although the extent of PLT regeneration in proximal sections seemed better than in mid- and distal sections, there was no statistical difference between sections (P = 0.130).

METHODS: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age 30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. RESULTS: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%).

Although numerous reviews have detailed their structure, molecular composition, and biomechanical properties, far less attention has been paid to their content of trace elements. Tendons and ligaments are generally rich in calcium, sulfur, and phosphorus, although there are intriguing differences between one tendon/ligament and another. Furthermore, there can be significant regional variations that correlate with the presence or absence of fibrocartilage in the ""wraparound"" regions of tendons or ligaments, where they change direction and press against bone. Here, their sulfate and calcium contents are particularly high. This is undoubtedly associated with the high levels of proteoglycans that are found in these cartilaginous tissues and the occasional presence of sesamoid bones within them. © Copyright 2006 by Humana Press Inc.",2006,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,151-161,,3-Jan,114,,Biol.

Oxidative stress contributes to atherosclerosis, and evidence of enhanced oxidative stress exists in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In a non-lupus murine model, we evaluated whether anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies could affect the oxidant/antioxidant balance as an early biochemical step of APS. Methods. Hybridomas producing human and murine aCL and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (aβ2-GPI) monoclonal antibodies were injected into three groups of five female BALB/c severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Corresponding hybridomas secreting non-antiphospholipid antibodies of the same isotype were employed as controls. Sera and organs were collected after 30 days. Paraoxonase (PON) activity, peroxynitrite, superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrotyrosine were measured in plasma. Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results. PON activity and NO (sum of nitrate and nitrite) levels were reduced in the human aCL IgG group (P <0.002 and P<0.04, respectively), whilst peroxynitrite and superoxide and expression of total antioxidant capacity of plasma were increased (Plt;0.01). PON and NO were decreased in the murine aβ2-GPI IgG and IgM aCL groups (P<0.03 and P<0.05, respectively). Nitrotyrosine was elevated in the human aCL IgG group (P<0.03). Western blotting showed reduced iNOS expression in the hearts of the IgG aCL group, confirmed by immunostaining. PON inversely correlated with IgG aCL titres (P<0.001), superoxide (P <0.008) and peroxynitrite levels (P<0.0009). Peroxynitrite and total IgG aCL were independent predictors of PON (P<0.0009 and P <0.02, respectively). Superoxide was the only independent predictor of NO (P<0.008) and of nitrotyrosine (P<0.002).

This retrospective clinical study analyses risk factors and outcome after arthrolysis in a large population. Material and methods: Two hundred twenty-three patients who had undergone arthrolysis after ACL reconstruction were examined. Range of motion (ROM) was reduced due to arthrofibrosis of the joint in 70% (n=156). Other reasons, such as cyclops syndrome or osteoarthritis were found in 30% (n=67). The mean time interval between arthrolysis and follow-up was 4.29 years. We recorded timing of surgery, additional injuries, state of the knee before reconstruction, range of motion, pain during rehabilitation, beginning, duration and type of rehabilitation, severity and etiology of joint stiffness and the time between ACL reconstruction and revision. The present state of the knee was documented using the IKDC form. Results: A significant correla tion of arthrofibrosis and preoperative irritation (plt;0.001), preoperative limited ROM (p=0.001), perioperative pain (p=0.046) and early beginning of muscle training (p=0.064) was found. Combination of a remaining loss of extension and development of degenerative joint disease was also significant (p=0.001). The decrease of sports activity compared with the level before ACL injury was highly significant (plt;0,001).

These are the doubled tibialis anterior (TA), doubled tibialis posterior (TP), and doubled peroneus longus (PL) tendons. Type of Study. A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. Methods: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. Results: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm2, 48 mm2, and 37 mm2, respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/mm) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. Conclusions: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources. The biomechanical properties observed for the TA, TP, and PL were noted in specimens despite an average age of 78.3 years.",2003,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,1091-1096,,10,19,,Arthroscopy J.

Electron microscopic analysis,American Journal of Sports Medicine,,0363-5465,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L25087240&from=export,"We studied human anterior cruciate ligament allograft specimens by quantitative electron microscopy to analyze their collagen fibril populations. The specimens were procured at the time of second-look arthroscopy from the superficial region of the midzone of the anterior cruciate ligament grafts after synovial clearage. The grafts used for the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were from fresh-frozen allogenic Achilles, tibialis anterior or posterior, or peroneus longus or brevis tendons and had been implanted 3 to 96 months previously. By 12 months after surgery, the anterior cruciate ligament allografts consisted predominantly of small-diameter collagen fibrils (30 to 80 nm), which resulted in a unimodal pattern in the collagen fibril profile. The number of large-diameter fibrils (90 to 140 nm) within the allogenic tendon grafts had decreased. This predominance of small-diameter collagen fibrils persisted in almost all specimens older than 12 months. The anterior cruciate ligament allografts had collagen fibril profiles that did not resemble normal tendon grafts or normal anterior cruciate ligaments, even several years after surgery.",1995,10/18/2025 11:41,10/18/2025 11:41,,203-209,,2,23,,AM.
