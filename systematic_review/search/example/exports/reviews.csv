This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendon (HT) autografts for primary ACLR. HYPOTHESIS: There would be no significant difference in patient outcomes between PLT and HT autografts in ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a thorough literature search was conducted on February 10, 2024, across the PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus databases. The aim was to identify comparative studies investigating the effectiveness of PLT and HT autografts for primary ACLR. The initial literature search retrieved 96 studies. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Data analysis was performed using RevMan Version 5.4.1. Functional scores, graft characteristics, donor site morbidity, and failure rates were compared. RESULTS: Ten studies involving 949 patients were included. Both the PLT and HT groups showed comparable functional outcomes, knee stability, and graft failure rates. PLT autografts demonstrated a larger mean graft diameter (8.63 mm vs 8.08 mm) and lower incidence of donor site morbidity (7.48% vs 22.01%) than HT autografts. There was a statistically significant mean difference (MD) favoring PLT autografts in the modified Cincinnati score (MD, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.84 to 4.81; P < .0001) and thigh circumference (MD, -7.62 mm; 95% CI, -8.90 to -6.33; P < .00001). CONCLUSION: This review showed that both PLT and HT autografts are effective options for primary ACLR, with similar functional outcomes and knee stability. PLT autografts offer advantages in terms of graft diameter and donor site morbidity. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and guide clinical decision-making in ACLR practice.","2025-09","2025-10-12 04:49:11","2025-10-12 04:49:11","","23259671251374313","","9","13","","Orthop J Sports Med","Peroneus Longus Tendon Versus Hamstring Tendon Autograft for Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40980562 PMCID: PMC12444037","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40980562","","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; hamstring tendon; systematic review; meta-analysis; peroneus longus tendon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study further evaluates the viability of the PLT autograft as a non-inferior alternative to the conventional HT autograft. METHOD: We independently searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science for all relevant articles from inception to March 2025, in only the English language. Clinical outcomes included: IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, Tegner-Lysholm score, Visual-Analog-Scale (VAS) score, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Modified Cincinnati score, graft diameter, thigh circumference, graft harvest time, Knee laxity & stability (Lachman test, Pivot Shift test, and Anterior Drawer test), and Donor-site morbidity. Funnel plots were used to detect publication bias. All statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.1.3). RESULTS: A total of 25 studies, 9 RCTs, and 16 cohort studies containing 1944 patients were included in this analysis. No statistically significant differences were observed between PLT and HT autografts in functional outcomes, including Tegner scores, Lysholm scores, Tegner-Lysholm scores, VAS scores, or objective measures of knee stability and laxity across all follow-up periods. Notably, the PLT group demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the HT group, including significantly larger graft diameter, reduced graft harvesting time, improved Modified Cincinnati Scores at both 12- and 24-month follow-ups, and lower donor-site morbidity rates. Despite significantly higher IKDC scores in the PLT group at 6 months postoperatively, no significant differences were observed at 12-, and 18, 24, or 36-month follow-up. Conversely, PLT groups had slightly lower AOFAS scores at 12 or 24 months follow-up than the HT group. CONCLUSION: The PLT autograft demonstrates comparable clinical outcomes to HT autograft in ACL reconstruction while offering distinct advantages, including significantly larger graft diameter, reduced harvest time, and lower donor-site morbidity. These benefits, coupled with equivalent postoperative functional results, position the PLT autograft as a promising alternative to traditional HT autograft. Long-term follow-up and higher-quality studies are needed to support our results and further investigate the differences between PLT autograft and HT autograft.

However, recent studies endorse the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft as a viable alternative. To evaluate this, we systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy of PLT against HT autografts. Our search encompassed Cochrane, Embase, OVID, PubMed, and Scopus databases for RCTs comparing outcomes of PLT and HT autografts in ACL reconstruction. Primary outcomes included Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, while secondary outcomes involved American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, graft diameters and donor-site complications. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) and heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics. 683 patients from 6 RCTs were included, with 338 (49.5%) patients treated with PLT autografts. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 30 months. Despite lower preoperative Lysholm scores in the PLT group, no significant differences were observed at 6 and 12 months. Although preoperative and 6-month IKDC scores were lower in the PLT group, no significant differences were found at 12 and 24 months. AOFAS scores showed no significant preoperative difference, but slightly lower scores were noted in the PLT group at 12 or 24 months. There was no significant difference in graft diameter, while donor-site complications were fewer in the PLT group. In summary, the PLT autograft is a promising and non-inferior alternative to the HT autograft, demonstrating equivalent outcomes in patient-reported knee and ankle metrics, comparable graft diameters and fewer donor-site complications.","2024-07","2025-10-12 04:49:11","2025-10-12 04:49:11","","2691-2699","","5","34","","Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol","Comparative effectiveness of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autografts versus hamstring tendon (HT) autografts in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38755499 PMCID: PMC11291530","","C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\RPMQRK35\Park et al.

A scoping review of randomised controlled trials","Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy: official journal of the ESSKA","","1433-7347","10.1002/ksa.12127","","PURPOSE: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation has been proposed to improve the results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The present study aims to quantify the available evidence to support the use of PRP as biological augmentation in ACLR surgery. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science and Embase databases on 10 March 2023. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), written in English, addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR surgery, with no time limitation. A scoping review was performed to map the body of literature by examining the evidence related to specific aspects of patients' treatment and evaluation. Risk of bias evaluation was performed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials Version 2 (RoB 2), while the quality assessment was performed with the use of the Coleman Score. RESULTS: Out of 983 articles retrieved, 23 RCTs on 943 knees were included in this scoping review. PRP was administered in a liquid form in nine studies and clotted in 11 studies, while in three studies both liquid and clotted PRP were used. Hamstring auto/allografts were used in 14 studies, patellar tendon auto/allografts were used in eight studies and one study described ACLR with peroneus longus allografts. The map of the evidence documented high heterogeneity also in terms of surgical technique, objective and subjective outcome measures and radiological assessment, as well as follow-up times ranging from 1 day to 2 years, with virtually no overlapping data among studies neither in terms of treatments nor evaluations. Risk of bias evaluation showed an overall low quality of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR is largely scattered. PRP was produced and applied following different procedures, and high variability was detected across the included studies for every aspect of ACLR surgery and evaluation. Currently, a meaningful comparison of the available studies is not possible as the quantification of the literature results is biased by their heterogeneity. Future studies should provide more standardisation to investigate the benefits of biological augmentation in ACL surgery and confirm the promising yet weak evidence of PRP potential as well as the most suitable application modality, before routine use in clinical practice.

The current review was performed to analyze the available evidence regarding PLT in the arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: A comprehensive search of literature was performed on March 1, 2023 using 5 databases (for manuscripts published between 2010 and 2023). All studies reporting ACL reconstruction with PL graft in adults ≥18 years were considered; and final studies were shortlisted based on specific exclusion criteria. RESULTS: The search identified 684 articles, among which 26 manuscripts were finally selected. PLT has been used in primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR), revision ACLR, ACLR in multiligamentous injuries and those at risk for anterior knee pain. The full-thickness PLT graft is variable in its dimensions with the mean size ranging between 7 and 8.8 mm (half-PLT grafts ≤8.1 mm). The ultimate strength of doubled PLT graft is significantly higher than native ACL and comparable to the quadrupled hamstring.There was statistically insignificant difference in the laxity and functional outcome of knee following ACLR with PLT, as compared with other autografts (p > 0.05). PLT harvest is associated with satisfactory clinical foot and ankle outcomes, as well as excellent regenerative ability. Overall, studies have demonstrated lower complications with PLT (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The dimensions of harvested PLT graft are more consistent than HT. It has similar functional outcome and survival, as compared to other autografts. It also has lower risk for donor-site morbidity and lower complications than HT.

There remain concerns related to these grafts, especially the potential impact on ankle functions. AIMS/OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review and meta-analysis is to summarize the available evidence for ankle functional outcomes after PL harvest. This will provide objective clinical evidence for surgical decision making. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cochrane, Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar were all searched for articles published between January 2001 and May 2021. For the aim of a systematic review, certain inclusion and exclusion criteria were adopted in accordance with PRISMA recommendations. The primary outcome measure was the assessment of ankle functional outcomes using validated instruments (such as AOFAS score, FADI score etc.). FINDINGS: A total of twelve studies representing pooled patient populations of 537 patients were included in this review. The average follow-up duration was 17 months (range; 6-32 months) across all studies. All twelve studies assessed AOFAS score and six studies also additionally assessed FADI score. The pooled mean outcomes measured showed a slight decrease in post-operative as compared to pre-operative AOFAS and FADI score (mean difference of AOFAS 1.92, 95% CI 1.021-3.123, p value < 0.05 and mean difference for FADI 1.50, 95% CI 0.561-2.445, p value < 0.05). Though statistically significant the magnitude of variance implies minimal clinical impact. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This review and meta-analysis found that PL autograft harvest leads to statistically significant but minimal impact on ankle functional outcomes. This, in conjunction with various studies on ankle parameters after PL harvest, shows that PL harvest leads to minimal impact on ankle outcomes and function.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of published literature in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and EMBASE databases was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria included patients undergoing ACLR with PLT autograft, inclusion of patient-recorded outcome measures, and availability in English language. Publications that included only biomechanical analysis or ACLR with use of allograft or combination grafts were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies (Level of Evidence range: I-IV) met inclusion criteria, with follow-up ranging from 3 months to 5 years. In the available case series, patient-reported outcomes ranged from Lysholm = 80.7 to 95.1, International Knee Documentation Committee 78.1 to 95.7. In prospective cohorts and randomized controlled trials, PLT performance was comparable with HT autografts (PLT/HT: Lysholm = 88.3-95.1/86.5-94.9, International Knee Documentation Committee = 78.2-92.5/87.4-93.4).

There was minimal donor-site morbidity associated with PLT harvest. CONCLUSIONS: Although limitations exist within the available literature, existing evidence suggests that PLT autograft routinely produces adequately sized grafts with comparable early outcomes to HT autograft and low risk of donor-site morbidity.

Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as an alternative autograft for reconstruction in kneeling populations and in simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current evidence on the outcome of primary ACLR with PLT autograft in adults and donor ankle morbidity, in addition to determining the average PLT graft dimensions from published studies. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and Virtual Health Library databases using the terms ""anterior cruciate ligament,"" ""peroneus longus"" and ""fibularis longus"" alone and in combination with Boolean operators AND/OR. Studies evaluating clinical and stability outcomes, graft-donor ankle morbidity and graft dimensions of PLT in ACLR were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (mCMS). A narrative analysis is presented using frequency-weighted means wherever feasible. Publication bias was assessed using the ROBIS tool. FINDINGS: Twelve articles with intermediate-level methodological quality were included. Eight studies assessing the clinical and stability outcomes of reconstruction with PLT showed satisfactory outcomes, similar to those of hamstring tendons (HT). No studies assessed anterior knee pain as an outcome. Six studies evaluated the graft-donor ankle morbidity using general functional foot and ankle scores and non-validated tools, showing favourable outcomes. Nine studies assessed PLT graft diameter, revealing grafts consistently larger than 7 mm among the different preparation techniques, which is comparable with reports of HT grafts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The clinical and stability outcomes of ACLR with different PLT autograft preparation techniques are comparable with those of HT during short-term follow-up; however, there is insufficient evidence to support its use in the populations that motivated its implementation. Thus, stronger evidence obtained with the use of validated tools reporting negligible donor-graft ankle morbidity after PLT harvesting is required prior to recommending its routine use, despite the consistency of its dimensions.

METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid (MEDICINE), and EMBASE databases were queried for original articles from clinical studies including the keywords: ACL reconstruction and PLT autograft. Studies comparing PLT autograft versus HT autograft were included in this analysis and the following data were extracted from studies meeting the inclusion criteria: graft diameter, functional outcomes (Tegner activity scale, Lysholm score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score), knee laxity (Lachman test), and complications (donor site pain or paresthesia, graft failure). Besides, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) pre-operation and at last follow-up were also compared among patients using PLT autograft. Meta-analysis was applied using Review Manager 5.3 and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies including 925 patients with ACL reconstruction met inclusion criteria. Of these, 5 studies included a direct comparison of PLT autograft (164 patients) versus HT autograft (174 patients). No significant difference was observed between PLT and HT autografts for Tegner activity scale, Lachman test, donor site pain, or graft failure. However, PLT groups demonstrated better Lysholm score (mean difference between PLT and HT groups, 1.55; 95% CI 0.20-2.89; p = 0.02) and IKDC subjective score (mean difference between PLT and HT groups, 3.24; 95% CI 0.29-6.19; p = 0.03). No difference of FADI was found (n.s.) but AOFAS was slightly decreased at last post-operative follow-up for patients with PLT autograft compared with pre-operative scores (mean difference of 0.31, 95% CI 0.07-0.54, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: PLT autograft demonstrated comparable functional outcomes and graft survival rates compared with HT autograft for ACL reconstruction. However, a slight decrease in AOFAS score should be considered during surgical planning. Hence, the PLT is a suitable autograft harvested outside the knee for ACL reconstruction to avoid the complication of quadriceps-hamstring imbalance which can occur when harvesting autografts from the knee.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate ankle performance following PLT harvest for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed by searching five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Inclusion criteria included: ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft, ≥6-month follow-up, and validated ankle outcomes (American Orthopaedic Foot And Ankle Society [AOFAS]/Foot and Ankle Disability Index [FADI] scores). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models using R software (version 4.4.3). Heterogeneity was assessed via I² statistics, and risk of bias was evaluated using JBI checklists. RESULTS: Twenty articles (1024 patients) were identified, comprising eleven prospective cohort studies and nine randomised clinical trials (RCT), based on title, abstract, and quality assessments. Meta-analysis demonstrated excellent postoperative ankle function, with pooled AOFAS scores of 96.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.6-99.3) at 6 months, 96.1 (93.9-98.2) at 12 months, and 97.2 (93.9-100.6) at 24 months. FADI scores similarly improved to 97.4 (96.0-98.9) by 6 months and 99.4 (98.7-100.1) at 24 months. Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age and AOFAS outcomes (β = -0.23, p = 0.36). Minor complications (e.g., transient hypaesthesia) occurred in 13%-23% of patients but resolved within months. No studies reported major nerve injuries or ankle instability. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields minimal donor-site morbidity, with consistently high AOFAS/FADI scores across all age groups. These findings support the safety of PLT autografts, though heterogeneity is evident, and the predominance of male participants and the regional focus of studies, mainly Asian populations, may affect generalisability.
