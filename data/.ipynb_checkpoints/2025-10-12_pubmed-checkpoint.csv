The use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction has been reported to offer significant potential benefits, such as preserving the hamstring tendons. However, its effects on the ankle must be considered prior to surgery. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study evaluating ankle morbidity using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, plantarflexion and eversion strength, and Clarke's angle on both extremities. Data were collected from patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test with SPSS v.26. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included, with the mean AOFAS scores of 58.88 (donor side) and 70.12 (contralateral side). Mann-Whitney test results showed no significant difference in AOFAS scores between the two sides (p=0.085). The mean plantarflexion strength values were 62.23 (donor) and 66.77 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.489). Additionally, the mean Clarke's angle values were 59.10 (donor) and 69.90 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.099). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in ankle function in patients who used the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft in ACL reconstruction.","2025","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","144731","","","17","","Orthop Rev (Pavia)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 41041434 PMCID: PMC12488067","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/41041434","","Ankle Morbidity; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Autograft; Peroneus Longus Tendon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate ankle performance following PLT harvest for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed by searching five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Inclusion criteria included: ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft, ≥6-month follow-up, and validated ankle outcomes (American Orthopaedic Foot And Ankle Society [AOFAS]/Foot and Ankle Disability Index [FADI] scores). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models using R software (version 4.4.3). Heterogeneity was assessed via I² statistics, and risk of bias was evaluated using JBI checklists. RESULTS: Twenty articles (1024 patients) were identified, comprising eleven prospective cohort studies and nine randomised clinical trials (RCT), based on title, abstract, and quality assessments. Meta-analysis demonstrated excellent postoperative ankle function, with pooled AOFAS scores of 96.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.6-99.3) at 6 months, 96.1 (93.9-98.2) at 12 months, and 97.2 (93.9-100.6) at 24 months. FADI scores similarly improved to 97.4 (96.0-98.9) by 6 months and 99.4 (98.7-100.1) at 24 months. Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age and AOFAS outcomes (β = -0.23, p = 0.36). Minor complications (e.g., transient hypaesthesia) occurred in 13%-23% of patients but resolved within months. No studies reported major nerve injuries or ankle instability. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields minimal donor-site morbidity, with consistently high AOFAS/FADI scores across all age groups. These findings support the safety of PLT autografts, though heterogeneity is evident, and the predominance of male participants and the regional focus of studies, mainly Asian populations, may affect generalisability.

Traditional sources, such as hamstring tendons, bone-patellar tendon-bone, and quadriceps tendon, are popular choices but may result in muscle imbalances and dynamic differences in knee kinematics. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as an alternative autograft for ACL reconstruction, offering comparable functional outcomes and avoiding interference with the flexor-extensor complexes of the knee. However, concerns about donor site paresthesia and ankle dysfunction have been raised in PLT harvesting. This article presents a detailed protocol for safely and effectively obtaining this autograft. The protocol emphasizes critical steps, modifications, and potential troubleshooting methods. In this study, we assessed functional scores, donor paresthesia, and other complications in 20 patients six months after PLT harvesting. Our findings indicate that this protocol for PLT acquisition did not result in significant complications. Therefore, we confirm the effectiveness of this protocol and offer guidance on essential preoperative preparations and surgical techniques.","2025-09-02","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","","","223","","","J Vis Exp","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40982415","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40982415","","Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Autografts; Humans; Tendons; Tissue and Organ Harvesting; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). STUDY DESIGN: Case series, Level of evidence 4. METHODS: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023.The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded. RESULTS: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively). CONCLUSION: The peroneus longus tendon can be safely used as an alternative autograft in ACLR without causing donor site morbidity. There may be a deficit in balance test performance.","2025-09","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","23259671251371229","","9","13","","Orthop J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40980563 PMCID: PMC12446790","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40980563","","anterior cruciate ligament; knee; meniscus; peroneus longus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. METHODS: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8 mm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10 mm with a graft tube, compression to 9 mm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. RESULTS: Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95 % CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608 N (SD: 233.12; 95 % CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037). Group 0 (native 8 mm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341 N (SD: 936.67; 95 % CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (p = 0.196). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9 mm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8 mm grafts.","2025-08","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","346-350","","","66","","J Orthop","Effect of diameter reduction by compression on peroneus longus allograft integrity","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40765794 PMCID: PMC12320093","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40765794","","Allograft; Anterior cruciate ligament; Compressed graft; Graft diameter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main mechanism of injury is usually when a pivoting injury occurs in which the tibia is translated anteriorly. At the same time, the knee is in a slight valgus and flexed attitude, and is predominantly found in contact sports like soccer. The variable symptoms that warrant medical attention usually include pain, swelling, knee giving way, difficulty ambulating, and reduced knee range of motion. The treatment usually depends on the patient's symptomatology, type of injury, the growth remaining in his or her growth plates, and activity goals. The purpose of the study is to determine the superior treatment modality for ACL injury in patients older than 40 years. Methodology The study was a prospective study conducted in the orthopedic outpatient department of a tertiary care center in northern India. A total of 60 patients were included in the study sample. Patients were divided into two treatment groups: Group A (n=30), consisting of conservatively managed patients, and Group B (n=30), consisting of surgically managed patients. Various symptoms during presentation were also noted in the study, which showed pain and instability as the predominant symptoms on presentation. Treatment modalities for ACL injury in our study include conservative management by physiotherapy and surgical management with ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus autograft. The physiotherapy protocol and post-surgery rehabilitation protocol were kept the same to compare the outcome in both groups. The Lysholm knee scoring scale was used to calculate the functional outcome of conservatively and surgically managed groups before intervention and post-intervention at the first, third, sixth, and twelfth months. The data was collected and summarized in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and analyzed with IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., using the ANOVA test, chi-square test, and paired t-test. A p-value of < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. Results The study was conducted with two groups (group A: conservative; group B: surgical group) with comparable demographic profiles and slight male predominance, comparing the functional outcome of surgically and conservatively managed middle-aged patients with ACL injuries. The Lysholm knee scoring scale showed a poor pre-intervention score in both groups. This subsequently improved over a period of one year of study for both groups. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score of 75.80±5.95 (group A) and 96.13±2.65 (group B), with a p-value of < 0.001, was noted, which showed a significantly superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population. Conclusions Sixty patients over 40 years of age were taken up for the study, with more than two-thirds of the study population being male. The study showed the pre-intervention Lysholm knee scoring scale for both groups to be ""poor."" The score remained ""poor"" even after the first month post-intervention. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score with an ""excellent"" outcome was noted in the surgical group (group B), which depicted an overall superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population.","2025-05","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e84489","","5","17","","Cureus","Comparison of Surgical and Non-Surgical Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Middle-Aged Population","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40539191 PMCID: PMC12178572","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40539191","","acl rehabilitation; anterior cruciate ligament (acl); arthroscopic acl reconstruction; conservative and surgical treatment; functional outcome of acl reconstruction; tegner lysholm knee scoring scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is a promising autograft for ACL reconstruction, with less donor site morbidity than traditional grafts like bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring tendons. This study evaluates donor site ankle morbidity after PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study at an Indian Government Medical College and Hospital from February 2023 to October 2024 involved 56 patients with symptomatic ACL tears who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using PLT grafts. Donor site morbidity was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using the visual analog scale for foot and ankle (VAS-FA) and American orthopaedic Foot and Ankle society (AOFAS) scores at 14 days, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Data were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 36.8 years and an average injury duration of 13.3 months. Donor site morbidity occurred in 66.1% of patients, mainly as mild pain and swelling, which improved significantly over time. VAS-FA scores dropped from 7.52 preoperatively to 2.05 at 6 months, and AOFAS scores increased from 54.8 to 80.0. Chronic injury duration (over 16 months) was associated with poorer recovery, while preoperative pain, gender, graft size, and weight-bearing duration had no significant impact on recovery outcomes. CONCLUSION: PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction leads to minimal donor site morbidity, with mild pain and swelling that improve over time. PLT grafts offer a promising alternative to traditional autografts, providing comparable outcomes and fewer complications. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results.","2025-06","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","207-212","","6","15","","J Orthop Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40520747 PMCID: PMC12159622","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40520747","","American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; peroneus longus tendon; visual analog scale for foot and ankle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These injuries often require specialized treatment strategies, with two-stage surgical reconstructions emerging as a viable option. This report examines a case of MLKI and the outcomes of a staged surgical approach to repair and reconstruct the affected knee ligaments. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old female sustained a multi-ligament injury to her right knee after a twisting event, resulting in pain, swelling, and instability. The patient underwent a two-stage arthroscopic reconstruction, beginning with repair of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner structures, followed by anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Autografts, including the bilateral peroneus longus and contralateral hamstrings, were used for the procedure. Her rehabilitation protocol emphasized early passive range of motion exercises, with delayed weight-bearing to promote effective healing. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the successful restoration of knee stability and function following a two-stage surgical approach to MLKI. The case underscores the need for individualized treatment plans and highlights the potential benefits of a phased procedure. While promising, further research is required to compare single-stage and two-stage approaches and to assess their long-term outcomes in managing complex MLKIs.","2025-05","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","190-197","","5","15","","J Orthop Case Rep","Comprehensive Arthroscopic Management of Multi-ligament Knee Injury","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40351634 PMCID: PMC12064225","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40351634","","arthroscopic repair; Instability; ligament injury; reconstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term donor site morbidity in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a PLT autograft. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with harvested PLT autografts, and all eligible patients were invited to participate in a clinical examination at the hospital. To evaluate their range of motion, all included patients underwent a physical examination. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). To evaluate foot and ankle structural changes, the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), arc height index (AHI), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (LTFMA), calcaneal pitch angle (CPA), and metatarsal angle (MA) were measured in the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side.

The mean follow-up time was 19.5 ± 3.4 years. AOFAS scores were excellent in 92.3% of patients (n = 24) and good in 7.7% (n = 2). The mean FAAM-ADL score was 99.6 ± 1.86. The mean FAAM-S score was 98.1 ± 5.94. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side for any of the measured parameters-including the IMA, HVA, AHI, LTFMA, CPA, and MA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated good to excellent long-term patient-reported outcomes and negligible radiographic changes after harvesting the full thickness PLT compared with the contralateral side. These long-term data strongly support PLT harvesting as an alternative graft choice and suggest that this method does not alter the natural history of foot and ankle structures.","2025-04","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","23259671251320659","","4","13","","Orthop J Sports Med","Harvesting the Full Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Is Not Associated With Structural Foot Impairments","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40297044 PMCID: PMC12035389","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40297044","","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; peroneus longus tendon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recent systematic review shows it is a safe and reproducible technique with low morbidity of donor sites (1). The method for PL harvest routinely involves tenodesis of the PL stump to the peroneus brevis (PB). To the authors' best knowledge, no study exists in the literature that has compared the outcomes of tenodesis versus no tenodesis on post-operative ankle functional outcome scores. The purpose of the present study is to assess the importance of tenodesis on post-operative ankle scores. METHODS: A total of 200 consecutive patients from July 2022 to November 2022 were included in the study: 72 in the no tenodesis group and 128 in the tenodesis group. Institutional ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics review committee before the initiation of the study. Demographic variables (age, gender and level of play) were recorded. Pre-operative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) and Functional Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were calculated for both groups and compared with post-operative scores at six weeks, three months, six months and one-year follow-up. RESULTS: For the entire study population (n = 200), we found that AOFAS and FADI scores showed no significant difference at any interval except for lower scores at six weeks of follow-up for both groups compared to baseline. We found that the no tenodesis group had slightly better AOFAS and FADI scores at the six-week follow-up, which were statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, the magnitude of variance (0.13 and 0.20, respectively) was too small to be clinically significant. Age, gender and level of play had no impact on ankle functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Tenodesis of the PL to the PB has been the standard norm in PL graft harvest for various ligament surgeries. The present high-powered prospective cohort study shows that tenodesis.does not improve ankle functional outcome scores compared to no tenodesis. Further work is needed to assess the impact of tenodesis or no tenodesis on ankle biomechanics (eversion, plantarflexion and gait).

This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length ≥ 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump ≥ 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. RESULTS: In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length ≥ 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.","2025-04-24","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","175","","1","25","","BMC Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40269891 PMCID: PMC12020297","","C:\Users\Danny\Zotero\storage\XD32AUHA\Chen et al.

Choosing the appropriate graft and determining the surgical treatment staging by assessing the likelihood of doing the most anatomical revision canals and placing them with the primary canals before surgery are crucial factors affecting treatment outcomes. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in the patient-reported functional outcomes in revision ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autografts in a single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients who were eligible for follow-up among 25 surgeries performed between 2015 and 2023 were included in this retrospective analysis and met the inclusion criteria. The patient reported functional outcome, Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity level, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain before the injury and during the most recent follow-up. The peroneus longus (PL) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) groups' patient-reported results were assessed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two revision groups with PL and BPTB autograft in terms of age, sex, duration between injury and surgery, concurrent injuries, and isolated or complex surgeries. There was not a significant difference between the groups' pre-injury patient-reported outcomes, including the Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity, and VAS for pain (n.s.). There was not a significant difference in the two groups' functional results at follow-up, although both groups' functional outcomes improved and all patients recovered to their pre-injury activity level. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings suggest that graft options (peroneus longus and BTB) and surgical complexities (isolated and complex revision) yield comparable functional outcomes for most measures. However, notable differences in post-operative pain levels warrant further exploration. These results underscore the effectiveness of both graft types and surgical techniques in achieving satisfactory recovery while acknowledging the necessity of customized approaches to pain management based on individual patient circumstances.","2025-04","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","221-228","","4","15","","J Orthop Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40212520 PMCID: PMC11981519","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40212520","","anterior cruciate ligament; Autograft; bone-patellar tendon-bone; peroneus longus; revision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0-120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. DISCUSSION: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. CONCLUSION: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation. Simultaneous reconstruction reduces hospital stays, anaesthesia exposure, and surgical risks while streamlining rehabilitation, enabling quicker patient recovery and improved outcomes.","2025-04","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","111150","","","129","","Int J Surg Case Rep","Management of a complex multiligament knee injury","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40106956 PMCID: PMC11964545","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40106956","","Graft; Hamstring; Harvesting; Multiligament knee injuries; Peroneus longus tendon; Posterior meniscus root tears; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18-20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group.

Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR.

ACL injuries are common, often leading to knee instability and subsequent complications. ACL reconstruction is a standard treatment option, with various autograft sources available. The anterior half of the peroneus longus (AHPL) tendon has emerged as a potential alternative autograft. This study aimes to examine the anterior knee pain in ACL reconstruction using AHPL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 51 patients with ACL injuries undergoing ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft. Patient demographics, surgical details, and Kujala scores were collected. RESULTS: The average age of our participants was 25.88 ± 5.39 years, with mean BMI classified as obese. Significant improvements in Kujala and KOOS pain scores were observed between each data collection. There was a negative correlation between baseline and three and six months post-operatively Kujala and KOOS pain scores with BMI. DISCUSSION: The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft significantly reduced anterior knee pain, as indicated by a better Kujala and KOOS pain score. Previous studies have highlighted concerns regarding anterior knee pain with other autograft sources, such as the patellar and hamstring tendons. The AHPL tendon autograft offers a promising alternative with favorable anterior knee pain and minimal donor site morbidity.

Altered kinematics might lead to changes in muscle loading, potentially affecting the energy demand of locomotion. Understanding alterations in muscle mechanics and energetics during landing could enhance the rehabilitation program design. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the muscle mechanics and energetics of individuals with CAI, copers, and healthy controls during single leg jump landing. Three groups, CAI, copers, and healthy individuals (total n = 66), performed the landing task, and data on 3D motion capture, ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activation were simultaneously collected. A musculoskeletal model was applied to estimate muscle force and mechanical power. Compared to healthy groups, individuals with CAI showed increased peak muscle forces in the gluteus maximus (p < 0.001), gluteus medius (p < 0.001), vastus lateralis (p < 0.001), and peroneus longus (p < 0.001) during landing. Whereas copers exhibited higher peak muscle forces in the vastus lateralis (p < 0.05), medial gastrocnemius (p < 0.05), soleus (p < 0.05), and peroneus longus (p < 0.001). Additionally, negative mechanical power redistribution in CAI shifted from the ankle to the hip (p < 0.001), while copers exhibited a similar redistribution from the ankle to the knee (p < 0.05). This study suggested that both CAI and copers exhibit biomechanical modifications in proximal joints. Copers showed a novel landing strategy aimed for enhancing landing stability, but with the risk of ACL injury. The identified energy redistribution observed in both CAI and copers could potentially contribute to the recurrent ankle sprains. This research facilitates a better understanding of how muscle mechanics and energy demands influence the landing pattern in individuals with CAI and copers.","2025-01-30","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e41901","","2","11","","Heliyon","Muscle mechanics and energetics in chronic ankle instability and copers during landing","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39897792 PMCID: PMC11783018","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39897792","","Biomechanics; Chronic ankle instability; Copers; Landing; Musculoskeletal model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft. Therefore, this article aims to describe the step-by-step technique for the inframalleolar PLT harvesting.","2025-04","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","100384","","","11","","J ISAKOS","Inframalleolar harvest of the peroneus longus tendon graft","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39805521","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39805521","","ACL graft; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Humans; Inframalleolar harvest; Peroneus longus; Peroneus longus tendon graft; Tendons; Tissue and Organ Harvesting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ± 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ± 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ± 3.9 (range = 85-100).

There are different types of grafts used, and the choice depends on several factors. Autologous grafts, from the patients themselves, are the most common option, with rapid incorporation and a lower failure rate. Allografts from donors have their role in specific cases. Synthetic grafts, used in the 1980s, have advantages such as the absence of morbidity at the donor site, but studies have shown long-term complications. Hybrid grafts, combining autologous grafts and allografts, have gained interest, allowing a larger diameter and reducing morbidity. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has received attention, with positive results, good knee function and less hypotrophy of the thigh at the donor site. Autologous quadriceps tendon graft has gained popularity, with results comparable to patellar and flexor tendon grafts, lower morbidity at the donor site and a lower rate of re-rupture. The choice of graft has evolved, with autologous flexor grafts being preferred for less active patients and patellar grafts with bone fragments for high-performance athletes. Allografts, synthetic and hybrid grafts have their role in specific circumstances. The choice must be based on scientific evidence, considering advantages and disadvantages. ACL reconstruction is a complex procedure that requires individual considerations to select the most appropriate graft.","2024-10","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e642-e649","","5","59","","Rev Bras Ortop (Sao Paulo)","New Graft Choices for ACL Reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39649040 PMCID: PMC11624934","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39649040","","anterior cruciate ligament; grafting; knee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Dogs with partial CCL rupture that underwent a unilateral TPLO were included. The population was divided into two groups: remnant CCL transected (study group) and left in situ (control group). Preoperative and 6-week postoperative measurements of PLT, in three specific locations, and patellar ligament length (PLL) were collected. Risk factors for PLT and shortening were also included. RESULTS: Fifty-two dogs (56 stifles) with partial CCL rupture were retrospectively included. Twenty-nine stifles (51.8%) had the remnant CCL transected (study group) and 27 stifles (48.2%) had the remnant CCL left in situ (control group). Significant differences were found on PLT measurements between pre- and 6-week post-surgery for all three ligament locations with greatest difference at the middle region. Median PLL was significantly shorter 6-week post-surgery for both groups. No significant differences in PLT nor PLL were identified between procedures where the remnant was transected or not. CONCLUSION: This study did not identify a protective effect of transecting the CCL remnant on PLT or patellar ligament shortening, contrary to other reports within the literature. Further investigation is needed in the form of prospective studies with higher number of cases to understand the clinical implications of patellar ligament thickening and shortening in dogs.","2025-07","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","153-161","","4","38","","Vet Comp Orthop Traumatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39572217","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39572217","","Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Male; Osteotomy; Patellar Ligament; Retrospective Studies; Rupture; Stifle; Tibia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peroneus longus (PL) grafts have garnered much attention recently due to ease of harvest and more reliable graft diameters. The present study aimed to study various anthropometric parameters associated with PL-graft diameters. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 50 patients undergoing PL harvest for ACL surgery at a tertiary referral hospital. Age, gender, height, weight, length of the lower leg (lateral tibial plateau to the tip of the fibula), circumference at the head of the fibula and girth at the lateral malleolus were measured pre-operatively. The length of the graft doubled and tripled graft diameters were assessed intra-operatively. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the association between the pre-operative anthropometric variables and the intra-operative graft diameters and length of graft harvested. RESULTS: The mean doubled and tripled PL-graft diameter in our study population was 7.7 ± 0.9 mm and 8.7 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. The mean length of the graft was 25.9 ± 3.5 cm. We found no significant correlation between graft diameters and age, gender or height of the patient. We found that the patient's weight significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with graft diameter. We also found that the length of the lower leg (p < 0.0001), circumference at the head of the fibula (p = 0.001) and girth at the lateral malleolus (p = 0.029) showed significant correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter.

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using tripled or quadrupled PLT autograft (if graft thickness exceeded 10 mm then tripled) or quadrupled HT autograft. Patients were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24-month post-operatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean diameter of the PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of the HT autograft, and the mean graft harvesting time was less (P < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 36 days earlier than those in the HT group (P < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity, and better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between the groups in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Despite some donor site complications, such as numbness and infection, both PLT and HT grafts offer acceptable knee stability. However, PLT grafts seem to provide superior subjective functional outcomes based on patient-reported scores. More research is needed to further establish these findings and optimize graft choices for individual patients.","2024-11","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","240-245","","11","14","","J Orthop Case Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39524299 PMCID: PMC11546024","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39524299","","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; donor site morbidity; functional outcomes; graft choice; hamstring tendon; peroneus longus tendon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5 ± 2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8 ± 9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30° flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9 ± 26.9- 71.3 ± 11.5, p < 0.001) and Lysholm (59.9 ± 28.5-80.5 ± 11.2, p = 0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values. The foot function score AOFAS showed no significant impairment (100 ± 0-99.3 ± 2.5, p = 0.250). Complications included cyclops lesions of ACL reconstruction in three patients. CONCLUSION: At 1-year follow-up, MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft for patients simultaneously undergoing ACL reconstruction satisfactorily restores knee stability, has a low ACL reconstruction failure rate and does not significantly impair foot function.

This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. MATERIAL AND METHODS ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot &amp; Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. RESULTS There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56±0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44±0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46±3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48±4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain. The peroneus longus tendon, with its larger diameter, fewer graft-related complications, and similar knee scores compared to the hamstring group, is considered a suitable alternative graft source.","2024-10-26","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e945626","","","30","","Med Sci Monit","Peroneus Longus vs Hamstring Tendon Autografts in ACL Reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39460374 PMCID: PMC11523759","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39460374","","Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Autografts; Female; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anthropometric measurements were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), fibular length, calf circumference, and ankle circumference. The Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) was used to assess activity levels. PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using ultrasonography. Two-stranded PLT graft thickness was calculated using the previously reported formula by Luo et al. A thickness of less than 8 mm of PLT graft was accepted as an insufficient autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of two-stranded PLT graft thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to establish the best threshold values. RESULTS: Males had a significantly greater PLT CSA (0.17 ± 0.03 cm2) and predicted two-stranded PLT graft thickness (8.1 ± 0.6 mm) compared with females (0.15 ± 0.03 cm2 and 7.5 ± 0.6 mm, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Correlation analysis revealed that two-stranded PLT graft thickness positively correlated with height, weight, BMI, fibular length, calf circumference, ankle circumference, and Tegner Activity Scale in both genders, with stronger correlations observed in females. The logistic regression model identified height and calf circumference as significant predictors of sufficient two-stranded PLT graft thickness (≥ 8 mm) in males, while calf circumference and the TAS were significant predictors in females. ROC analysis demonstrated that calf circumference and the TAS had acceptable discriminatory abilities in females, with 36.25 cm and ≥ 4 cutoff points, respectively. However, no anthropometric variables in males exhibited strong discriminatory abilities for predicting two-stranded PLT graft thickness CONCLUSIONS: Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females.

Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. HYPOTHESIS: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL-Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 ± 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged ≤25 years (P = .007). Neither donor age (≤40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P > .05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. CONCLUSION: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.","2024-08","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","23259671241254115","","8","12","","Orthop J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39135859 PMCID: PMC11318055","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39135859","","ACL; allograft; carbon dioxide; chromatography; knee; ligament; supercritical fluid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population. MATREIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients. RESULTS: 20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 ± 1.34 and 98.5 ± 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 ± 9.43 and 88.75 ± 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886±22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 ± 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio. CONCLUSION: While the use of peroneus longus tendon autografts in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction does not seem problematic on short-term subjective assessment, there is objective evidence in keeping with evertor weakness, weakness of first ray plantar flexion and possible ankle instability.

Many studies have investigated the efficacy of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and donor site morbidity has not been adequately studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using PLT were included. Ankle strengths of the patients evaluated with an analog dynamometer. Ankle range of motion (ROM) was measured with a smart phone inclonometer application. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the postoperative ankle strength(eversion, plantar flexion) in the donor area and the preoperative period (p=0.6 and p=0.7, respectively) and contralateral healthy side (p=0.6, p=0.6, respectively). Ankle ROM angles (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, inversion) were significantly lower in the post-operative period compared to the preoperative period and contralateral healthy side (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative AOFAS scores (p=0.2).

However, there are concerns regarding donor site morbidity. This study aims to compare the functional outcome of ACL reconstruction using hamstring (HT) and PLT autografts and evaluate the donor site morbidity. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (HT and PLT). Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Knee functional outcome was evaluated with IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores preoperatively, and postoperatively after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements, subjective evaluation of sensory disturbances, and ankle scoring with AOFAS and FADI scores. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, the PLT group showed comparable IKDC (p = 0.925) and Tegner-Lysholm (p = 0.600) scores with those of the HT group. The mean graft diameter in the PLT group (7.93 ± 0.52 mm) was larger compared with the HT group (7.43 ± 0.50 mm) (p < 0.001). The incidence of thigh atrophy (HT-16.7%, PLT-10%) and sensory disturbances (HT-73.3%, PLT-10%) was greater in the HT group. There was no significant ankle donor site morbidity in the PLT group (AOFAS-98.67 ± 3.45, FADI-99.23 ± 1.69). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction with PLT had comparable functional outcome with that of HT at 1 year. However, PLT demonstrated larger graft diameter, less donor site morbidity, and enhanced muscle recovery without significantly affecting the ankle function. PLT can be safely used as an acceptable alternative graft choice harvested from outside the knee for ACL reconstruction.","2024-07","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","979-986","","7","58","","Indian J Orthop","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38948366 PMCID: PMC11208339","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38948366","","ACL reconstruction; ACL tear; Autograft; Hamstring tendon; Peroneus longus tendon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: To create an open-access data set on the morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of clinically important tendons and ligaments of the lower limb, using consistent methodologies, to enable direct tendon/ligament comparisons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nineteen distinct lower limb tendons and ligaments were retrieved from 8 fresh-frozen human cadavers (5 male, 3 female; aged 49-65 years) including Achilles, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, fibularis (peroneus) longus, fibularis (peroneus) brevis, flexor hallucis longus, extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, flexor digitorum longus, quadriceps, patellar, semitendinosus, and gracilis tendons; anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments; and 10 mm-wide grafts from the contralateral quadriceps and patellar tendons. Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSAUS], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression. RESULTS: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSAUS, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons. CONCLUSION: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties-key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models. The complete data set has been provided to facilitate further investigations, with the capacity to expand the resource to include additional outcomes and tissues.","2024-07","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","2391-2401","","9","52","","Am J Sports Med","The Biomechanical, Biochemical, and Morphological Properties of 19 Human Cadaveric Lower Limb Tendons and Ligaments","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38910352","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38910352","","Aged; allograft; anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); autograft; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cadaver; Female; Humans; Ligaments; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; reconstruction; Tendons; Tensile Strength; tissue mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The choice of graft material in ACL reconstruction is crucial for optimal postoperative results, and this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the comparative efficacy of these two graft types. Method This open-label randomized comparative study involved a carefully selected cohort of patients undergoing single-bundle arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PL graft group or the hamstring graft group. Surgical procedures were conducted using standardized techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols were closely monitored. Functional outcomes, including range of motion, stability, and patient-reported measures, were assessed at predefined intervals to ensure comprehensive data collection. Results The study underscores significant demographic and clinical factors in ACL reconstruction outcomes. Participants were predominantly aged 17-30 years (58.33%) with a mean age of 29.27 years and exhibited a male predominance (80.56%). Common complaints included knee pain and instability, primarily due to falls from bikes (55.56%) or sports-related trauma (44.44%). Notably, PL grafts demonstrated advantages over hamstring grafts, with longer mean length (10.11 mm vs. 8.77 mm, p=0.0001) and shorter operation times. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner Lysholm scores show no significant differences between grafts over the period of time. There is no notable foot eversion weakness or significant donor site morbidity after the PL graft harvest. Hamstring graft cases exhibit a higher incidence of altered sensation and muscle atrophy, suggesting the potential benefits of PL grafts for improved surgical outcomes. Conclusions Graft comparisons favored PL grafts due to longer length, and functional outcome assessments between the two graft types. However, foot and ankle strength assessments revealed fluctuations in strength recovery with PL grafts, highlighting the need for tailored rehabilitation. Thigh circumference variations suggested potential muscle atrophy in the hamstring graft group, along with reported paresthesia in the ipsilateral proximal leg. In conclusion, PL grafts offer potential advantages for ACL surgery, but ongoing monitoring and specialized rehabilitation are crucial.","2024-05","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e60239","","5","16","","Cureus","Functional Outcome of Single-Bundle Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using Peroneus Longus Graft and Hamstring Graft","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38872693 PMCID: PMC11169999","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38872693","","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; foot and ankle; hamstring graft; peroneus longus graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A human knee model study","Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery","","1434-3916","10.1007/s00402-024-05357-8","","INTRODUCTION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains associated with the risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces. METHODS: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. RESULTS: The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation. CONCLUSION: This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.","2024-06","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","2703-2710","","6","144","","Arch Orthop Trauma Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38727813 PMCID: PMC11211157","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38727813","","ACL rupture; ALL; AML; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Anteromedial stabilization; Biomechanical Phenomena; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Rotation; Tibia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system-Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. RESULTS: One year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.","2024-06","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","1317-1326","","6","16","","Orthop Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38650179 PMCID: PMC11144498","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38650179","","Adolescent; Adult; Ankle Joint; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Knee function scores; Male; Middle Aged; Peroneus longus tendon; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Tendons; Three‐dimensional gait analysis; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft. RESULTS: Clinically, as a mean Lysholm score of all patients, they were revealed to be consecutively high in G1 than in Group 2 at four, six, and eight months. The signal-to-noise ratio from the MRI results showed majority having good healing in G1 group. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 6-month MRI, an effective ligamentization (SNR<75) was noticed in 53.33% of patients in the dHACM allograft enhanced group on comparison with 33% in the controls. The overall results show that the augmentation of dHACM allograft to ACL reconstruction yields in good patient outcomes at post-operative follow-up.","2024-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","33-41","","1","18","","Malays Orthop J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38638668 PMCID: PMC11023350","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38638668","","allograft; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; dehydrated human amnion chorion membrane; signal-to-noise ratio; tegnor lysholm score","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Data from the Natural Corollaries and Recovery after ACL injury multicenter longitudinal cohort study were analyzed. Between May 2016 and October 2018, patients aged between 15 and 40 years, who had experienced an ACL tear within the last 6 weeks and sought medical attention at one of seven healthcare clinics in Sweden, were invited to participate. The mean time from injury to MRI was 19.6 ± 15.2 days. An orthopedic knee surgeon and a musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed all the MRI scans. The following structures were assessed: posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) complex, lateral collateral ligament (LCL), popliteus tendon, medial meniscus (MM), lateral meniscus (LM), and cartilage. In addition, the presence of bone bruising, impaction fractures in the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) or posterolateral tibia (PLT), and Segond fractures were also assessed.  RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (48.4% males) with a mean age of 25.4 ± 7.1 years were included. The prevalence of associated injuries was as follows: PCL (0.4%), MCL {41.3% [superficial MCL and deep MCL (dMCL) 16.5%; isolated dMCL 24.8%]}, LCL (2.4%), MM (57.4%), LM (25.2%), cartilage (15.0%), bone bruising (92.9%), impaction fracture in the LFC (45.7%) and PLT (4.7%), and Segond fracture (7.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of associated injuries in patients with ACL tears was high.

The intricate coordination of joint movements relies heavily on the ACL's screw-home mechanism, a crucial element for synchronizing knee movement with neighboring joints. Despite its indispensable role, the ACL is susceptible to injury, necessitating surgical intervention. While many patients experience positive outcomes following ACL reconstruction surgeries, a significant proportion face the challenge of procedure failure. The key to success lies in the healing process within the tibial and femoral bone tunnels. The post-ACL reconstruction phase introduces its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of returning to sports (RTS), underscoring the importance of reinstating neuromuscular and motor function. The trajectory of rehabilitation is influenced by factors such as graft healing, patient age, gender, pain levels, and concurrent injuries. Materials and methods This prospective observational study spanned 2.5 years, enrolling 71 patients with diagnosed ACL injuries. Arthroscopic reconstruction utilized hamstring autografts and peroneus longus autografts. A nine-month post-surgery follow-up employed the Lysholm scoring system for comprehensive evaluations. Results Over 2.5 years, 87.3% of male and 12.6% of female participants underwent arthroscopic reconstruction. Lysholm scores revealed 28.1% excellent, 45.0% good, and 26.7% fair outcomes, with no participants in the unsatisfactory range. Lysholm scores demonstrated positive outcomes, indicating the efficacy of arthroscopic reconstruction in enhancing knee function. Findings align with existing literature, emphasizing positive results from ACL reconstruction techniques and specific implants. Comparisons with related studies highlight challenges in standardized return-to-sport guidelines and underscore the need for outcome measure standardization. Conclusion The study contributes nuanced insights into ACL reconstruction outcomes, emphasizing positive functional recovery trends at the nine-month follow-up. Lysholm scores indicate favorable outcomes, supporting the procedure's effectiveness. Consideration of specific implants adds practical value. Despite limitations, this study enriches ACL reconstruction research, promoting advancements in patient care and outcomes. Ongoing research with extended follow-ups and larger cohorts will enhance understanding and refine ACL reconstruction strategies.","2024-02","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e53480","","2","16","","Cureus","Functional Outcomes in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38440040 PMCID: PMC10910190","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38440040","","anterior cruciate ligament (acl) reconstruction; arthroscopic surgery; knee function; lysholm score; neuromuscular rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. METHODS: A single-center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. RESULTS: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/- 0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/- 0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre-op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre-op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre-op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre-op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/- 2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction. Further, without a peroneal tenodesis, the functional outcomes of the donor ankle remained excellent.","2024","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","116-122","","2","12","","Arch Bone Jt Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38420524 PMCID: PMC10898795","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38420524","","ACL reconstruction; Ankle; Hamstring; Peroneus longus tendon; Tenodesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the quadruple hamstring tendon (semitendinosus and gracilis) was measured in a sample of Iraqi adult males. The study enrolled 300 Iraqi men who underwent anterior cruciate ligament repair at Diwaniyah Teaching Hospital and Alforat Alawast Private Hospital between January 2020 and December 2021. The repair procedure was based on the utilization of the quadruple (gracilis and semitendinosus) hamstring tendon. The primary outcome measure was the size of the tendon, determined using a sizing tube calibrated to 0.5 mm. Out of the sample, 80% of patients had a graft diameter of 7.5 mm, while 15% had a graft diameter of 8 mm, and 5% had a diameter of 7 mm. Body mass index was a poor predictor of graft size, whereas patient height was an excellent predictor of graft diameter. The graft diameter in most Iraqi subjects with anterior cruciate ligament injuries needs to be five bands or even six bands; otherwise, other graft sources like bone-patellar-bone or peroneus longus tendon grafts should be considered. The graft diameter may be reliably anticipated based on the patient's height.","2023-10","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","1445-1447","","10","16","","J Med Life","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38313178 PMCID: PMC10835557","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38313178","","ACL: Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Adult; anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; hamstring graft; Hamstring Muscles; Humans; Iraq; ligament anterior cruciate; Male; Tendons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to explore the changes in the ankle and gait after using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a reconstruction graft for the anterior cruciate ligament. METHODS: A total of 20 patients, 6 males and 14 females, aged 18 to 44 years, with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries, underwent reconstruction using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft between June 2021 and December 2021. The part on which the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was harvested was considered the experimental group, while the contralateral foot was the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups. RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Through our study of the surgical experimental group we have shown that harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon does not affect foot morphology and gait parameters; however, it does impact the gait cycle.","2024-01-16","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","69","","1","19","","J Orthop Surg Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38225652 PMCID: PMC10790475","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38225652","","Ankle; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Female; Gait; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Peroneus longus tendon; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts' biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozen + 21 kGy gamma irradiation, frozen + 21 kGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4 months) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at -80 °C. All groups were subject to 60 s static creep test with 250 N load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4 months) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam. Increased storage time affects negatively the evaluated mechanical properties.","2024-01","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","111904","","","162","","J Biomech","The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts - Continued","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38134466","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38134466","","ACL reconstruction; Allograft; Allografts; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Biomechanical tests; Creep; Deformation; Humans; Sterilization; Tendons; Transplantation, Homologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

In this context, the peroneus longus tendon graft appears as an option to complement other grafts, transforming a thin quadruple graft into a sextuple graft. INDICATIONS: The sextuple graft technique for ACL reconstruction is used in patients who have a quadruple graft with a diameter of less than 8 mm, and due to its length, it is not possible to make a quintuple graft, for example. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: Initially, the hamstring tendons are removed with the aid of a tenotome. After that, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon is identified and removed. On the back table, the definitive graft is prepared so that we have a sextuple graft with a diameter greater than 8 mm. Finally, the ACL reconstruction is performed anatomically using an adjustable loop device in the femur and an interference screw in the tibia. RESULTS: In our experience with patients who have a hamstring graft diameter of less than 8 mm, we obtained an average increase of 1.8 mm in graft diameter when augmentation was performed with the anterior half of the peroneus longus. DISCUSSION: Grafts less than 8 mm in diameter are at increased risk of rupturing and failure of surgical treatment of the ACL injury. The surgeon must be prepared to make a quintuple or sextuple graft, but in some patients, the tendons are short or there is no availability of a tissue bank, making this practice impossible. The use of the anterior half of the peroneus longus to perform graft augmentation is safe, causing almost no morbidity to the donor area and is easily accessible during the procedure, making it an excellent option for increasing the diameter of thin grafts.

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and complications between revision ACLR using allografts and PLT autografts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who underwent arthroscopic revision of ACLR with complete clinical follow-ups between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Allograft was used in 44 of these patients, and PLT autograft was used in 15 of them. Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, Lachman, and anterior drawer tests were performed after a mean follow-up of 60months (range: 19-116). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to evaluate the donor ankle functions. Clinical outcomes and complications were compared between groups. RESULTS: Both groups showed significantly improved functional outcomes compared to their preoperative assessments. However, both groups had similar clinical results at the final follow-up, including Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity scale, knee range of motion, return to sports, time to return to daily activities, and rate of re-rupture. No major complications were seen in any of the patients. The AOFAS score was 99.13±2.64 in the PLT autograft group without loss of ankle muscle strength, deformity, instability, and permanent iatrogenic neurovascular injuries. The cumulative cost of the allograft group was significantly higher than the PLT autograft group. CONCLUSIONS: The PLT autograft might be an alternative autograft option to allografts due to similar clinical outcomes, low donor site morbidity, and reduced cost in ACLR revisions, especially if the primary ACLR was performed using grafts harvested around the knee.

The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals. RESULTS: PT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count.

The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (× 109/L), RBC (× 1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (× 109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33-15.24, 3.73-5.32, 10.33-13.95, 32.22-42.29, 169.66-413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99-15.55, 3.33-4.98, 9.71-13.17, 30.26-40.07, 172.34-372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22-14.14, 3.54-4.98, 9.80-13.97, 31.11-42.70, 151.30-417.14, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.

Therefore, researchers have explored other options, including the peroneus longus (PL) autograft. INDICATION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (both primary and revision), as well as multiligament reconstruction, particularly in areas where access to allografts is limited. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: A 3-cm longitudinal skin incision is placed 2 fingerbreadths (or 3 cm) proximal to the tip of the lateral malleolus, and 3 mm posterior to the fibula. The PL and peroneus brevis tendons are identified and isolated, followed by a tenodesis at the distal limit of the incision. The PL is whipstitched proximal to the tenodesis site, and then incised between the tenodesis and whipstitched portion. A closed tendon stripper is inserted and advanced proximally until the PL graft is released. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: PL autograft harvest has been shown to generate thicker and longer grafts relative to the semitendinosus, with demonstrated efficacy in terms of both biomechanical and clinical outcomes. Current literature points largely to a good safety profile, although there is still conflicting evidence in terms of foot and ankle morbidity and no mid- to long-term follow-up data available.

The advantages of percutaneous LCL reconstruction include small incisions, minimal soft tissue disruption, less postoperative pain, and speedy rehabilitation and recovery. The aim of this study was to report the functional outcome of percutaneous LCL reconstruction and overall patient satisfaction in Africans. METHODS: This prospective and interventional study involving 51 patients with chronic LCL rupture who had percutaneous LCL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft was conducted between January 2021 and December 2022 in National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dala-Kano, Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were patients between the ages of 18 and 45 years with chronic isolated LCL and not more than 1 injury of knee ligament. Exclusion criteria were active infection, and multi-ligament knee injury requiring 2-staged surgery. The knee functions were assessed preoperatively, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using the Lysholm scoring system. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of the treatment was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Relevant information was recorded into Microsoft Excel sheet and data was analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 for windows. The paired samples t-test was used to compare the clinical outcomes as continuous variables. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was (30.10 ± 5.90) years. The median time from injury to surgery was 7 months (ranging from 3 to 28 months). The mean follow-up period was (14.07 ± 3.13) months. The mean preoperative and 1-year postoperative Lysholm scores were 44.33 ± 12.97 and 97.96 ± 1.23, respectively.

However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1β stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. RESULTS: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study illustrated that the administered Plt-exos could alleviate knee OA by attenuating cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, possibly serving as a novel promising treatment for OA in the future.","2023-09","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","2975-2985","","11","51","","Am J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37551685","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37551685","","Aged; Animals; Blood Platelets; cartilage; Cartilage Diseases; Cartilage, Articular; Chondrocytes; exosomes; Exosomes; Humans; Mice; osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis, Knee; platelet; X-Ray Microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19±8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing.","2023-08","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","42-49","","Suppl3","62","","Acta Clin Croat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40337648 PMCID: PMC12054457","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40337648","","Adolescent; Adult; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Anterolateral ligament; Female; Humans; Male; Plantaris tendon; Prospective Studies; Quadriceps Muscle; Quadriceps tendon; Tendons; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But there are potential risks and complications associated with its use as a graft. This retrospective study aimed to examine the complications and donor site morbidity following PLT harvesting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on an institutional digital patient database, and all patients who underwent ligament reconstruction using PLT autograft were identified. Intraoperative, early, and late complications were reviewed using digital patient notes and patients underwent a complete physical examination during their final follow-up. Ankle function was assessed using the AOFAS score, and manual ankle muscle testing was performed on both sides. Sural nerve iatrogenic injury was evaluated with a dermatomal light touch examination. Cosmetic satisfaction due to incision scar and footwear complaints were also assessed. RESULTS: 82 patients (74 male, eight female) with a mean age of 31.9 ± 10.4 years (range, 16-66) were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up time was 46.6 ± 30.3 months (range, 6-109). The mean AOFAS score for the donor side was 98.7 ± 3.3 (range, 87-100), and the contralateral side score was 100, with manual muscle testing graded as 5 in all movements and similar to the contralateral side. Fifteen patients (18.3%) had hypoesthesia over the dorsolateral aspect of the foot distal to the incision scar, two patients (2.4%) had hyperalgesia over the distal incision scar, and one patient (1.2%) had mild ankle instability. There were two cases (2.4%) of compartment syndrome, both of which were treated with fasciotomy and had complete regression of symptoms after 5 days. One patient (1.2%) had a transient peroneal nerve injury and foot drop that resolved in the sixth month. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest that harvesting the PLT is associated with a high rate of complications and donor site morbidity. The most common complication was hypoesthesia around the lateral side of the foot, although the ankle functions were not affected significantly. Two cases of compartment syndrome and one transient peroneal nerve injury were observed. Care should be taken while harvesting PLT autograft, and it should be kept in mind that peroneal nerve injury might occur.

There is very little literature on it. Hence, our study aims to compare the functional outcomes, knee stability, donor site morbidity, and assessment of thigh muscle wasting in patients with ACL injury managed by arthroscopic single bundle reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendons (HT), respectively. Methods All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL deficiency were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups. Results One hundred and ninety-four patients (hamstring n = 96, peroneus n = 98) met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences between the preoperative, six-month postoperative, and one-year postoperative scores between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (p=0.356) and Lysholm knee score (p=0.289). The mean for the AOFAS was 99.05 ± 3.56 and 99.80 ± 0.70 in the PLT and HT groups, respectively, showing no statistical difference, with a significant improvement in thigh muscle wasting among the PLT group at final follow-up (p < 0.001). Conclusion We observed similar knee stability and functional outcomes and no obvious donor site morbidity among both groups. These patients also had better responses to physiotherapy in recovering from their thigh muscle wasting. So, we can recommend that a PL graft can be a safe, viable, and effective option for usual arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.","2023-04","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e37273","","4","15","","Cureus","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37168157 PMCID: PMC10164842","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37168157","","american orthopaedic foot and ankle society; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; bone-patellar tendon-bone (bptb); hamstring tendon; hamstring tendon grafts; hamstring tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis); peroneus longus tendon graft; road traffic accident","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, clinical data on graft size are limited. PURPOSE: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 ± 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 ± 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 ± 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 ± 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). CONCLUSION: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT.","2023-06","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","1743-1751","","7","51","","Am J Sports Med","Peroneus Longus Split Versus Semitendinosus Tendon Autograft Size","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37092720","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37092720","","ACL; anthropometrics; Autografts; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; knee ligaments; Ligaments, Articular; peroneus longus; semitendinosus; Tendons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three- and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. RESULTS: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals.

The hypothesis was that US can accurately predict the diameter of 2PLT autografts during operation. METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent ligament reconstruction with 2PLT autografts were included. Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 cm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5 mm. RESULTS: CSA at 1 cm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6 + 0.2 × [sonographic CSA of PLT at 1 cm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6 + 0.5 × Calf length. CONCLUSION: The diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.

The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P < .001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. The peroneus longus tendon can be considered a safe, effective, and promising graft of choice for arthroscopic primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction because it has a good functional outcome and impressive donor ankle function after surgery.","2023-03-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e32943","","9","102","","Medicine (Baltimore)","A prospective study of arthroscopic primary ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36862908 PMCID: PMC9981376","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36862908","","Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Foot; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Lower Extremity; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Tendons; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring autografts have been considered the gold standard for decades. Despite the good clinical outcomes, donor-site morbidity is a concern for both of these grafts2. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has also been considered as a potential graft for many orthopaedic reconstructive procedures3. The biomechanical properties and thickness of such a graft permit its use for ACL reconstruction3,4. The tensile strength of a peroneus longus tendon autograft is the same as that of a hamstring autograft and greater than that of a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and a quadriceps tendon graft3,5. We aimed to describe the steps to harvest the peroneus longus tendon autograft during single-bundle ACL reconstruction. DESCRIPTION: Identification of anatomical landmarks is performed, including the distal aspect of the fibula and the posterior border of the fibula, 2 cm above the tip of the bone. A longitudinal incision is made along the posterior border of the fibular bone, from 2cm above the tip of the fibula. Care is taken to identify the tendon sheath that covers the longus and brevis approximately 2 cm above the superior extensor retinaculum, and the peroneus longus is stitched to the peroneus brevis. The proximal aspect of the peroneus longus tendon is whipstitched, after which the peroneus longus tendon and surrounding soft tissues are incised. The peroneus longus tendon is then released with use of a closed stripper, and the graft is prepared. ALTERNATIVES: Alternative nonoperative treatment options include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rest, and limitation of sporting activities. Alternative surgical treatment options include arthroscopic debridement, ACL repair or reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring-tendon autograft, and ACL reconstruction with allograft. RATIONALE: Recent studies have shown that ACL reconstruction with use of a peroneus longus tendon autograft is safe and effective, with less donor-site morbidity compared with other tendon autografts4,6,7. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: The peroneus longus graft has been accepted for ligament reconstruction because of its strength, safety, and less donor-site morbidity7. The peroneus longus graft allows surgeons to harvest the autograft via a relatively small incision, resulting in fewer donor-site complications4. According to Rhatomy et al., the use of a peroneus longus graft provides good functional outcomes that are comparable with those of a hamstring autograft, but it has a larger graft diameter and its harvest results in less thigh hypotrophy8. Additionally, a case series of 10 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with use of a peroneus longus autograft showed satisfactory Lysholm scores and low disability according to the Foot and Ankle Disability Index9. IMPORTANT TIPS: Examination under anesthesia and arthroscopic confirmation of the ACL tear are recommended prior to harvesting the peroneus longus tendon.Take care to identify the anatomical landmarks of the peroneus longus and brevis.Tenodesis of the peroneus longus to the brevis is performed first, followed by whipstitching of the peroneus longus proximal to the site of the tenodesis.Once the peroneus longus tendon is passed through the closed stripper, gently maintain traction on the sutures while pushing the stripper proximally until the tendon is freed.Care should be taken not to damage the superior peroneal retinaculum, which provides the primary restraint to tendon subluxation.Identification of the peroneus longus and brevis is important. The peroneus longus tendon is free of muscle attachment and more rounded in shape, while the peroneus brevis contains muscle fibers.

Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. RESULTS: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (β = 15.45 mm2; Šidák adjusted P < .0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (β = -17.20 N per year; adjusted P = .0253), and increased CSA (β = 1.92 mm2 per inch; adjusted P < .0001) and maximum load (β = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P < .0001) with each inch of increased height. CONCLUSION: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely. The findings indicate that age negatively affected only the Achilles tendon (maximum load) and challenge the exclusion of donors aged >65 years across all tendon grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings support including a broader range of tendons for use as allografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and reviewing the current exclusion criterion of donors aged >65 years.","2023-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","768-778","","3","51","","Am J Sports Med","Challenging the Perceptions of Human Tendon Allografts","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36594505","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36594505","","Achilles Tendon; ACL; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Allografts; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; biomechanics of tendon; Female; graft; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; musculoskeletal; reconstruction; tissue mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Thirty patients with complete ACL tears were operated on. In all these patients, the thickness or length of the hamstring graft taken was found to be inadequate (less than 8 mm and 7.5 cm, respectively). So, additionally, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) graft was harvested to reach an optimum size of the final graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six weeks, three months, and six months. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score at six months was used to assess ankle stability. RESULTS: The mean age in our study was 28.8 years with male predominance (73.33%). The mean operative time was 86.4 minutes. The mean hamstring graft thickness in our study was 6.5 mm, which improved to 9.12 mm after augmentation. The mean graft length after AHPLT augmentation was 9.38 cm. The mean IKDC score at six months was 87.35. At the end of six months, FADI scores were found within normal limits (range: 135-136) in all the patients. No complications were noted in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: The AHPLT graft was always found to be sufficient enough for augmenting the hamstring graft to reach an acceptable thickness and length.

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24-31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P<0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. CONCLUSION: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be an appropriate autograft for ACLR due to its strength, larger graft diameter, and avoiding potential complications of hamstring autograft obtained from the knee region.","2022-08","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","695-701","","8","10","","Arch Bone Jt Surg","Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft versus Hamstring Tendon Autograft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36258748 PMCID: PMC9569136","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36258748","","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Hamstring tendon autograft; Peroneus longus tendon autograft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20° flexion angle. A standardized 12-N·m varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. RESULTS: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 ± 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 ± 0.6 and 2.2 ± 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P = .387). CONCLUSION: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With the current findings, understanding the effect of ACL and posterolateral corner injuries on lateral gapping under varus stress can aid in correctly diagnosing knee injuries and determining appropriate treatment plans.","2022-06","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","23259671221100216","","6","10","","Orthop J Sports Med","Effect of Sectioning of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Posterolateral Structures on Lateral Compartment Gapping","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35693457 PMCID: PMC9178986","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35693457","","anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; knee; varus stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The intraoperative time for tendon extraction was significantly shorter in Group A than Group B. Twenty-four months after operation, patients in the two groups showed the alleviated tibial posterior displacement and the increased IKDC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score. Nevertheless, these scores showed no significant differences between the two groups. Additionally, compared with the therapy using the four-stranded hamstring tendon, therapy using the double-stranded PLT is simpler and safer. DISCUSSION: Both surgical methods are effective in the treatment of PCL injury. The PLT could be a good choice for PCL injury reconstruction material, especially when the four-stranded hamstring tendon is accidentally damaged or ineffective. Our study may provide guidance for the clinical treatment of PCL injury.

The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. PURPOSE: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-N·m force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P = .863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ± 0.83-cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL-posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ± 1.02-cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ± 1.35-cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P = .154). CONCLUSION: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The side-to-side difference in heel height may be a clinically relevant examination tool for diagnosing multiligament knee injuries.","2022-04","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","23259671221086669","","4","10","","Orthop J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35450304 PMCID: PMC9016545","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35450304","","ACL injury; FCL injury; heel height; knee hyperextension; medial collateral ligament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. RESEARCH QUESTION: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (n = 27) and ligament dominance (n = 27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (P < 0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance.","2022-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","225-229","","","93","","Gait Posture","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35183840","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35183840","","ACL injury; Ankle; Ankle joint; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Athletes; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hip joint; Humans; Knee Joint; Leg; Ligament dominance; Ligaments; Muscle co-contraction; Muscle, Skeletal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traumatic posterior root of medial meniscus (PRMM) tears are commonly found in high-grade injuries involving anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears along with MCL tears. Diagnosis of these injuries can be made by a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but they can be missed at times due to severe soft-tissue swelling in the acute phase. CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old gentleman presented with injury to the front of his left knee 5 days back. On examination, he had a Grade 3 effusion with valgus stress test and posterior drawer test being positive and medial joint line tenderness was present. A firm localized swelling was palpable on the medial joint line. MRI scan revealed a mid-substance PCL tear, ACL sprain, PRMM tear, and tibial side rupture of superficial MCL with proximally migrated wavy MCL fibers lying below the medial meniscus confirmed on arthroscopy. Medial meniscus root repair by pull through technique and PCL reconstruction with a 3-strand peroneus longus graft followed by open MCL repair with augmentation using a semitendinosus graft was performed. Postoperatively, the knee was kept in a straight knee brace for 4 weeks, followed by a hinged knee brace and appropriate physiotherapy were started. At 2 years follow-up, the patient had attained full range of knee motion with good quadriceps strength, tibial step off maintained, and negative posterior drawer test and valgus stress test. Displacement of torn MCL into the medial knee compartment is an extremely rare injury. Proximal or distal avulsion of MCL with intra-articular incarceration has been reported in isolation or associated with ACL tear. Such an injury triad as reported here has not been reported in the literature to the best of our review. CONCLUSION: In our case, we report a very unusual injury triad of PCL tear, PRMM tear, and distal MCL tear with intra-articular entrapment below the medial meniscus operated by a single-stage surgery with excellent outcomes.","2021-08","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","28-32","","8","11","","J Orthop Case Rep","Tibial Avulsion with Intra-Articular Entrapment of Medial Collateral Ligament with Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tear with Posterior Root Medial Meniscus Tear","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35004370 PMCID: PMC8686511","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35004370","","intra-articular entrapment; Medial collateral ligament tear; posterior cruciate ligament tear; posterior root medial meniscus tear; unusual triad","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neglected injuries have a direct impact on the prognosis due to residual instability, chronic pain, deformities, and failure to repair other structures. Several techniques are used to reconstruct the posterolateral corner, often with autologous ischiotibial grafts or homologous grafts. An option little used for knee ligament reconstructions is the peroneus longus tendon graft. Although reported as a good alternative for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, we found no case using a peroneus longus tendon graft for posterolateral corner reconstruction. Here, we describe the case of a patient who underwent a non-anatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral corner using a peroneus longus tendon graft. The patient underwent surgical procedures for ligament reconstruction and correction of the deformity caused by a failed graft, but his knee remained unstable. During the preoperative planning, it was decided to reconstruct the posterolateral corner with an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft. Studies have shown that the peroneus longus tendon graft does not increase ankle morbidity, and that its length and diameter favor ligament reconstruction. Thus, the present article highlights the importance of the proper diagnosis of ligament injuries in the acute phase, and describes a new technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction that must be included in the surgeon's body of knowledge, increasing the amount of technical options.","2023-12","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e968-e972","","6","58","","Rev Bras Ortop (Sao Paulo)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38077768 PMCID: PMC10708983","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38077768","","anterior cruciate ligament injuries; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; joint instability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study also investigated whether the occurrence of patellar ligament thickening (PLT), which is commonly observed 2 months postoperatively after TPLO, is associated with misplacement of the osteotomy. A total of 120 dogs weighing more than 20 kg, 40 of which were control animals, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Stifles were radiographically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively on the side with CCLR and on the healthy contralateral side and compared with clinically normal stifles. PLT was reassessed after 2 months. RESULTS: Significant decreases in median patellar height ratio were found after both procedures (TPLO 0.24 (0.05-0.8); CCWO 0.22 (0.05-0.4)). The postoperative craniocaudal patellar position and the median AMA angle differed significantly among the groups (P = 0.000) (TPLO 87.5% caudal to the AA and 3.12° (0.76-6.98°); CCWO 100% cranial to the AA and 0° (- 1.34-0.65°); control group 5% caudal to the AA and 0.99° (0-3.39°)). At 8 weeks, PLT grade differed significantly in the two operated groups (P = 0.000) (TPLO 40% 0-2, 20% 2-4, 40% > 4; CCWO 98.8% 0). CONCLUSIONS: TPLO and AMA-based CCWO are associated with significant decreases in patellar height; however, the PLT results 2 months postoperatively differed between the two groups; the decrease in patellar height and PLT were independent of osteotomy position in the TPLO group. Compared to TPLO, CCWO results in reduced postoperative AMA angles and craniocaudal patellar positions that more closely resemble those of unaffected dogs, suggesting that the CCWO procedure allows us to better correct the caudal bowing of the proximal tibia that is often associated with deficient stifles in large dogs with TPA > 30°.","2021-12-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","368","","1","17","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34861875 PMCID: PMC8641203","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34861875","","AMA angle; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Canine; CCWO; Cranial cruciate ligament; Dogs; Osteotomy; patella; Retrospective Studies; Tibia; Tibial anatomic axis; Tibial mechanical axis; TPA; TPLO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is no published literature regarding the anthropometric predictors for the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft obtained in ACL reconstruction through the inframalleolar approach. METHODS: Fifty-two patients were finally evaluated for anthropometric parameters to predict quadrupled PLT graft diameter in ACL reconstruction using the inframalleolar technique. Intraoperative quadrupled PLT graft diameter was correlated to the patient's anthropometric data such as age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. We used regression analysis in a stepwise manner to ascertain anthropometric indices associated with the graft diameter. RESULTS: This study included 46 males and six females. Mean age was 28.2 ± 7.4 years, mean height was 172.7 ± 2.8 cm, mean weight was 75.6 ± 3.4 kg, mean BMI was 25.3 ± 0.9 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 9.2 ± 3.9 months, and mean graft diameter was 9.3 ± 0.4 mm. Positive correlation with graft diameter was found only with height (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and weight (r = 0.4, P < 0.01). On analysing through linear regression, height and weight had significant association with graft diameter, and we formulated the following prediction equation: PLT graft diameter (mm) = 0.083 × height (cm) + 0.011 × weight (kg) -5.854. CONCLUSION: Patients' characteristics, including height and weight, have a significant correlation with quadrupled PLT graft diameter and the average diameter of graft is > 9 mm through this approach.","2021","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","377-384","","5","11","","Int J Burns Trauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34858717 PMCID: PMC8610825","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34858717","","Anterior cruciate ligament; anthropometry; inframalleolar approach; peroneus longus graft diameter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-five young (16 ± 1 years), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10 s), VIBRATION (20 s) and POST (20 s) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a ""rigid"" strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a ""plastic"" strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (p < 0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (p < 0.05).

Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. METHODS: This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. RESULTS: Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22-31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5-8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p =  < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients.

The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery. Classical mechanical tests have been performed with various types of tendons, however, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus tend to suffer the least biomechanical changes after irradiation. Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21 kGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21 kGy) and storage times (5 and 6 months) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading. Static creep tests were performed with 250 N load during 60 s. Deformation at the end of the loading phase of both tendons was significantly smaller after 5 months long storage than that after 6 months long storage. TE5 showed significantly less creep than group TE6, and TE6 significantly greater than PE6. The creep of TE5 was significantly lower than that of TG5.

Therefore, an alternative autograft option with adequate strength and less donor site morbidity will be very valuable. Peroneus longus tendon has been found to be a promising option. INDICATION: Primary ACL reconstruction. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: Peroneus longus tendon graft is harvested with a longitudinal skin incision at 2 to 3 cm (2 finger-breadths) above and 1 cm (1 finger-breadth) behind the lateral malleolus, followed by superficial fascia incision in line with skin incision. The peroneus longus and peroneus brevis tendons were then identified. The tendon division location was marked at 2 to 3 cm above the level of the lateral malleolus. After that, an end-to-side suture was performed between the distal part of the peroneus longus tendon and peroneus brevis tendon. The peroneus longus tendon was stripped proximally with a tendon stripper to at least 5 cm from the fibular head to prevent peroneal nerve injury. Graft preparation was performed with a standard procedure to obtain the suitable graft size. In routine arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, peroneus longus tendon graft fixation can be performed with a cortical suspension device, bioabsorbable screws, or a combined technique. RESULTS: Recent studies showed that peroneus longus autograft had a comparable outcome with hamstring tendon autograft in primary ACL reconstruction at a 1-year follow-up. The use of peroneus longus tendon autograft resulted in larger graft diameter and less thigh hypotrophy. The mean (±SD) for the AOFAS-Hindfoot Score in the peroneus longus group was 97.3 ± 4.2, while the mean FADI score was 98 ± 3.4, both of which were considered excellent results. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of peroneus longus autograft in primary ACL reconstruction is a safe procedure with an excellent outcome. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be recommended as an alternative graft in single-bundle ACL reconstruction. Further study of the functional outcome and knee stability evaluation is recommended.","2021","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","26350254211009888","","4","1","","Video J Sports Med","Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 40309384 PMCID: PMC11883406","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40309384","","ACL reconstruction; donor site; hamstring; peroneus longus; tendon graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. PURPOSE: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30° of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. RESULTS: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 ± 0.62 vs 7.0 ± 2.18 mm, respectively; P < .001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 ± 8.27, 50.9 ± 8.50, and 1.8 ± 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 ± 2.61, 95.2 ± 2.64, and 6.8 ± 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P < .001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred. CONCLUSION: All-inside ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft produced good functional scores and stability without obvious ankle-site morbidity.","2021-06","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","2325967121991226","","6","9","","Orthop J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34212065 PMCID: PMC8216365","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212065","","all-inside; anterior cruciate ligament; peroneus longus tendon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. The choice of graft is principal in providing optimal knee stability after surgery. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is an autograft modality that offers unique benefits for ACL reconstruction cases. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a case of ACL reconstruction surgery using PLT graft in a patient with a confirmed ACL rupture. Assessment of post-surgical pain, knee stability, and ankle function were performed to determine functional outcome and donor site morbidity. The follow-up results revealed favorable recovery and improvement in all objective parameters. DISCUSSION: Post-operative biomechanical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score. The use of PLT in ACL reconstruction established an excellent potential for its satisfactory result and comparable to other graft modalities in widely used evidence-based findings.

However, all these grafts are associated with many complications. Lately, peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has shown promising results in this field, although there is still a dearth of data on its use. We, therefore, aimed at carrying out a study to evaluate the functional outcome and knee stability results of ACL reconstruction using PLT graft. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a completely torn ACL were included in the study. The PLT was harvested, and graft length, thickness, and harvesting time were noted intraoperatively. Knee stability and functional scores were evaluated clinically and using Lachman test (primarily) and KT-2000 arthrometer and subjectively with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 6, 12, and 24 months (secondary outcome) postoperatively. Ankle scores were also recorded by making use of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS)-Hindfoot Scale. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. The graft harvest time was 7.4 min (5-9 min). The mean thickness of the graft on doubling was 7.9 mm (7-9 mm). Ninety-six percent of the patients were satisfied with their results of the knee surgery, and 95% of the patients had no complaints of ankle joint. The mean IKDC score postoperatively was 78.16 ± 6.23, and the mean AOFAS score was 98.4 ± 4.1. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using PLT graft yields a good functional score (IKDC, KT-2000 arthrometer) even at 2-year follow-up. It is a safe and effective autograft option for ACL reconstruction.","2021","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","42-47","","1","27","","Niger J Surg","Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34012241 PMCID: PMC8112358","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012241","","Anterior cruciate ligament; autograft; peroneus longus tendon; reconstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A clinical data of 30 patients with PCL injury, who were admitted between December 2015 and September 2018 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon and TightRope technique. Among them, 19 were male and 11 were female, aged 17-48 years (mean, 28.2 years). The PCL injury was caused by traffic accident in 8 cases, sport in 14 cases, falling and bruising by a heavy objective in 5 cases, and other injuries in 3 cases. The interval between injury and operation was 10-90 days (mean, 39.3 days). The PCL injury was rated as grade Ⅱ in 6 cases and grade Ⅲ in 24 cases. The posterior drawer test was positive in 26 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 24 cases. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 61.37±8.49, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was near normal in 2 cases, abnormal in 8 cases, and significantly abnormal in 20 cases. The modified Lysholm knee score was 62.20±5.67. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (101.83±8.15) °. RESULTS: The operative time ranged from 70 to 110 minutes (mean, 79.7 minutes). All incisions healed by first intetion. All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 19.0 months). There were 3 cases of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity after operation, and 1 case of approximately 10° limitation of knee extension. At last follow-up, the posterior drawer test was positive in 2 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 1 case, with significant differences compared with the preoperative period ( χ 2=38.571, P=0.000; χ 2=36.274, P=0.000). The IKDC score was 84.67±3.67, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was normal in 16 cases, nearly normal in 10 cases, abnormal in 3 cases, and significantly abnormal in 1 case; the modified Lysholm knee score was 90.37±4.49; all of the above indexes were significantly better than preoperative ones, and the differences were significant ( t=-12.387, P=0.000; Z=-2.810, P=0.005; t=-22.865, P=0.000). Knee ROM was (88.33±9.86)° at 1 month after operation and reached (113.33±13.48)° at last follow-up, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). MRI re-examination showed that the form and position of reconstructed PCL were satisfactory. CONCLUSION: It can obtain good short-term effectiveness for PCL injuries by arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon, which has the advantages of reliable surgical approach, safe operation, and precise effectiveness.","2021-05-15","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","556-561","","5","35","","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33998207 PMCID: PMC8175203","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998207","","Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Arthroscopy; Female; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; peroneus longus tendon; posterior cruciate ligament; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Retrospective Studies; semitendinosus tendon; single-bundle reconstruction; Tendons; TightRope technique; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ± 6.73, and 29.6 ± 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision. Allograft ACL reconstruction is a good alternative to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon graft.

A human knee model study","The Knee","","1873-5800","10.1016/j.knee.2021.02.026","","BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. METHODS: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. RESULTS: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. CONCLUSION: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered.","2021-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","381-389","","","29","","Knee","Does the anterolateral ligament protect the anterior cruciate ligament in the most common injury mechanisms?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33711673","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711673","","ACL rupture; ALL; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Computer Simulation; Humans; Knee Joint; Knee model; Ligaments, Articular; Models, Biological; Range of Motion, Articular; Rotation; Rotatory instability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6 weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48 ± 9.9 years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2%) or chondral (40.7%) injuries. At the 2 years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p = 0.0001) IKDC score (p = 0.0001), Lysholm score (p = 0.0001), and range of motion (p = 0.001).

HYPOTHESIS: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. RESULTS: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 ± 0.40 vs 2.09 ± 0.54 N, respectively; P = .006) (stiffness: 3.43 ± 0.56 vs 1.75 ± 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P < .001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 ± 1.13 vs 7.14 ± 0.94 N, respectively; P = .008) (stiffness: 4.45 ± 0.75 vs 3.36 ± 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P = .008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 ± 4.98 vs 5.16 ± 3.98, respectively; P < .001) (EA: 19.66 ± 7.19 vs 10.85 ± 2.16, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 ± 5.04 vs 17.11 ± 7.31, respectively; P = .010) (MT: 21.15 ± 2.58 vs 15.55 ± 4.48, respectively; P = .041) (EA: 20.75 ± 3.87 vs 10.64 ± 3.94, respectively; P = .003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 ± 8.05 vs 15.21 ± 7.60, respectively; P = .007) (EA: 25.19 ± 6.38 vs 13.94 ± 7.10, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 ± 4.45 vs 47.80 ± 6.16, respectively; P < .001) (MT: 33.15 ± 3.88 vs 13.76 ± 4.07, respectively; P < .001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 ± 17.49 vs 182.97 ± 14.35 μm, respectively; P < .001), 8 weeks (58.86 ± 10.99 vs 90.15 ± 11.53 μm, respectively; P = .002), and 12 weeks (42.70 ± 7.96 vs 67.29 ± 6.55 μm, respectively; P = .001) than in the HB group. CONCLUSION: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction may result in improved biomechanical properties and tendon-bone incorporation compared with a hybrid graft. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Augmenting small autografts with allograft tissue may result in decreased biomechanical performance and worse tendon-bone incorporation, increasing the risk of graft failure.","2020-12","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","3515-3524","","14","48","","Am J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33141598","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141598","","ACL; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; autograft; Autografts; biomechanical performance; hybrid graft; Male; rat model; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; tendon-bone incorporation; Tendons; X-Ray Microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Eighty healthy New Zealand white rabbits were harvested to prepare ACL injury models and randomly divided into two groups ( n=40). The ACL was reconstructed with vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft in group A and peroneus longus tendon graft without blood supply in group B. The survival of animals and the healing of incision were observed after operation; the grafts were taken for gross and histological observations at 4, 8, and 16 weeks; the biomechanical test of the grafts was carried out to record the maximum tensile strength and incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks. RESULTS: All animals survived until the experiment completed. General observation showed that the tunnel was combined with grafts, the vascular infiltration was abundant, and no obvious boundary between the tunnel and grafts existed at 16 weeks in group A; there was still an obvious boundary between the tunnel and graft in group B. Histological observation showed that the collagen fibers between tendon and bone in group A increased gradually, the dense fiber connection was formed, and the ""tidal-line"" like structure similar to the normal ACL insertion was formed at 16 weeks; but the""tidal-line"" like structure was not obvious in group B. Biomechanical test showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks between group A and group B ( P=0.680; P=0.590), but the maximum tensile strength at 8 and 16 weeks were higher in group A than in group B ( t=18.503, P=0.001; t=25.391, P=0.001).

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 35 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy between October 2017 and October 2018. There were 19 males and 16 females with an average age of 43.4 years (range, 18-60 years), with 20 cases of left knee and 15 cases of right knee. The causes of injury included traffic accident in 14 cases, falling injury in 13 cases, and sports injury in 8 cases. The time from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean, 4.7 days). The patients suffered from swelling, pain, and limited mobility of knee joint before operation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were positive before operation, whereas MRI was taken to confirm the ACL rupture. After operation, the patients were followed up every 3 months until the knee joint's function returned to normal. MRI and X-ray films were used to observe the tendon-bone healing as well as the position of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were conducted to observe the improvement of knee joint mobility. The functional improvements were evaluated by the International Knee Documents Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee injury and osteoarthritis (KOOS) score. RESULTS: All the 35 patients were followed up 12-18 months, with an average of 14.2 months. The incisions healed by first intention, and no complications such as infection, joint stiffness, and rerupture occurred. Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test turned to be negative of all patients. MRI showed that the ACL was continuous, and the tendon-bone in the distal femur tunnel and proximal tibia tunnel recovered well after operation. X-ray films showed that the positions of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail were stable. The IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with those before operation, and the scores were further improved with time after operation ( P<0.05).

Among the available methods to predict PLT measurements, anthropometric parameters are one of the most accessible and feasible methods. The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. METHOD: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. RESULT: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length.

However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 ± 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .55), with means of 65.87 ± 7.63 N and 66.96 ± 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .68), with means of 150.64 ± 11.67 N and 152.10 ± 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 ± 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 ± 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. CONCLUSION: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity.

Lachman test showed that the anterior translation more than 5 mm in 2 cases, and the others were negative; while the valgus stress test showed that all patients were positive. At 6 months after operation, the Lysholm score and IKDC score of knee joint were 90.2±1.8 and 93.5±2.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than preoperative scores ( t=31.60, P=0.00; t=29.91, P=0.01); AOFAS score of ankle joint was 97.86±0.68, with no significant difference compared with preoperative score ( t=2.89, P=0.08). KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: The method of ACL reconstruction via arthroscopic GraftLink technique with PLT and MCL repair via suture anchor fixation has the advantages of less knee injury and faster recovery, and there is no significant impact on ankle function after tendon removal.","2019-06-15","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","685-688","","6","33","","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31197994 PMCID: PMC8355763","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197994","","Adult; anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Arthroscopy; autologous tendon; Collateral Ligaments; Female; GraftLink technique; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; medial collateral ligament; Middle Aged; suture anchor; Suture Anchors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regardless the potential, there was no study about the use of PLT autograft in Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcome and donor site morbidity after single bundle PCL reconstruction using PLT autograft. METHODS: Patient who met inclusion criteria, enrolled to this study and underwent single bundle PCL reconstruction using PL tendon autograft. Clinical outcomes were assessed with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati scoring systems, Lysholm score, and Serial hop test (single hop test and triple hop test) 2-year after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed with Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle (AOFAS) scoring system. RESULTS: Fifteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (11 males and 4 females). PLT graft diameters were 7.5-10 mm (mean: 8.30 ± 0.65 mm). Significant increase of functional score (p < 0.05) were found two years after surgery. Mean score of IKDC was 47.58 ± 11.75 pre-operative; 78.17 ± 4.52 post-operative, Modified Cincinnati was 48.86 ± 12.22 pre-operative; 79.00 ± 4.82 post-operative, Lysholm score was 49.26 ± 11.54 pre-operative; 80.20 ± 5.04 post-operative.

Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. METHODS: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000 cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. FINDINGS: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x < 40 yo, 40 yo ≤ x < 60 yo, 60 yo < x). INTERPRETATION: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness.","2019-07","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","90-95","","","67","","Clin Biomech (Bristol)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31082636","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082636","","ACL reconstruction; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Allografts; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Autografts; Biomechanical Phenomena; Biomechanics; Female; Foot; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Peroneus longus tendon; Pressure; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Transplantation, Homologous; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. METHODS: Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE. White blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelet count (PLT), IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, anti-cardiolipin (Acl), ANA, AnuA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, β2-GPI, urinalysis, and 24 h urine protein were measured by standard laboratory techniques. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. RESULTS: The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P = 0.0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P = 0.017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.","2019","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","7430780","","","2019","","J Immunol Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31049359 PMCID: PMC6462327","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049359","","Adult; Autoantibodies; Blood Sedimentation; C-Reactive Protein; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Phosphorylating); Humans; Intracranial Pressure; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Lupus Vasculitis, Central Nervous System; Male; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 ± 0.7 mm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 ± 0.8 mm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 ± 4.2 and for the FADI 98 ± 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.

METHODS: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. RESULTS: Ultimate load to failure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 ± 49.6 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87 N) versus 719.6 ± 69.6 N (95% CI, 671.38-767.82 N; P = .044). Less graft elongation at failure was observed in the supplemented group (3.1 ± 1.5 mm; 95% CI, 2.07-4.17 mm) versus the control group (21.0 ± 21.2 mm; 95% CI, 6.31-35.69 mm; P = .052). The number of grafts undergoing a 5-mm or greater change in length at failure was 1 of 8 in the supplemented group versus 5 of 8 in the control group (P = .038). CONCLUSIONS: Inner-limb supplemental tibial fixation results in higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation in a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside ACL reconstruction graft construct.

METHODS: The levels of serum s-Eng were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 139 patients with APS, 44 patients with SLE but no APS, 37 patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), 23 patients with Bechet's disease (BD), 22 patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and 22 persistent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) positive individuals without SLE or APS (simply aCL positive group) and 87 health controls (HC) without any auto-immune diseases. These APS patients included 64 primary APS patients and 75 APS patients secondary to SLE.The correlation between the clinical data, laboratory parameters, and serum s-Eng levels were analyzed.Independent samples t test, paired t test, Chi-square Test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's χ2 test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: (1) The serum levels of s-Eng were significantly higher in the patients with APS whether primary or secondary to SLE than in the health controls and simply aCL positive group and the patients with other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, pSS, BD and SSc (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum s-Eng levels between simply aCL positive group and health controls [(5.17±2.00) mg/L vs. (5.04±1.11) mg/L, P>0.05]. (2) The best cut-off value for the diagnosis of APS was no less than 8.37 mg/L as mean ± 3SD value, with the sensitivity at 0.772 and the specificity at 0.928. The Youden index was 0.700. These results indicated good validity of s-Eng as a diagnostic marker for APS. (3) The proportions of artery thrombosis and pathological pregnancy were higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than that in s-Eng-negative group (46/81 vs. 19/58, 29/65 vs. 10/44, respectively, all P<0.05). The levels of PLT were lower in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients (72.00×109/L vs. 119.00×109/L, P<0.001). (4) The proportions of the presence (93.83% vs. 37.93%, P<0.001) and titer (61.70 U/mL vs. 15.45 U/mL, P<0.001) of aCL were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group. The proportions of the presence (61.73% vs. 43.10%, P<0.05) and titer (33.48 U/mL vs.17.40 U/mL, P<0.05) of anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group too.

Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, gender, age, duration of injury, and preinjury activity levels, were recorded. t tests, correlation coefficients (Pearson r), and a multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter of the graft obtained.The mean PLT graft diameter was 8.3 mm, and 21 patients (13.5%) had a diameter less than 8 mm; 85 patients (54.5%) had a diameter between 8 and 9 mm, and 50 patients (32.0%) had a diameter greater than or equal to 9 mm. The correlation analysis showed that height (P < .001), weight (P < .001), and duration of injury (P = .012) were significantly related to graft diameter.

Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. METHOD: Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5-1 mm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70-220 N for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young's modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer's solution at 37 °C and the CSA recorded over 12 h. Twelve compressed and 12 control quadrupled grafts were mounted in porcine femurs, placed in Ringer's solution for 12 h at 37 °C and graft displacement at the bone tunnel aperture recorded under cyclic loading. RESULTS: Mean decreases in CSA of 31% under a stress of 471 kPa and 21% under a stress of 447 kPa were observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12 h compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3 mm for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement.","2018-08","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","2430-2437","","8","26","","Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc","ACL graft compression","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29623378","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29623378","","ACL reconstruction; Animals; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Compression downsizing; Femur; Humans; Isotonic Solutions; Ringer's Solution; Swine; Tendon graft biomechanics; Tendons; Tensile Strength; Transplantation, Homologous; Transplants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 ± 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 ± 7.1 vs. 89.3. ± 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 ± 0.57 vs. 1.85 ± 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 ± 0.36 vs. 0.10 ± 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 ± 1.40 vs. 99.5 ± 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up. An AHPLT autograft may be a good alternative for all-inside ACL reconstruction with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.","2018-11","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","1022-1030","","10","31","","J Knee Surg","All-Inside Single-Bundle Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with the Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Compared to the Semitendinosus Tendon","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29421837","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29421837","","Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Strength; Prospective Studies; Tendons; Transplant Donor Site; Transplantation, Autologous; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to compare revision rate and patient-reported outcomes following primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft versus a preoperatively planned hybrid autograft-allograft. At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. From this collection of patients, a matched-pair comparison was made between groups, with patients matched by gender, age at the time of surgery, and follow-up time. Revision rate at follow-up was 8.4 and 2.4% in the A and H groups, respectively (p = 0.073). A total of 148 surveys were completed (83 A, 65 H), from which 36 matched pairs were formed. Within the matched pairs, average age at surgery did not differ significantly between groups (A: 35.7 years, H: 36.0 years, p = 0.23). Time to follow-up was 4.3 and 3.7 years in the A and H groups, respectively. Patients with a hybrid graft had significantly higher KOOS Quality of Life subscores (A 69.6, H 79.2, p = 0.028), subjective IKDC scores (A 72.6, H 79.7, p = 0.031), and SANE scores (A 83.2, H 91.4, p = 0.015) at follow-up. Otherwise, no significant differences were found in patient-reported outcome scores between groups. A preoperatively planned hybrid graft, with use of a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated allograft, should be considered as a viable alternative for primary ACLR in older patients.","2018-10","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","827-833","","9","31","","J Knee Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29294500","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294500","","Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transplantation, Autologous; Transplantation, Homologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We addressed whether altered muscular activity is such a factor. METHODS: 16 participants with unilateral, non-reconstructed ACL rupture were scored for altered movement patterns according to Test for Substitution Patterns (TSP), which includes the single-leg squat (SLS). Surface electromyography (SEMG), was recorded in the lower extremities at initiation of weight-transfer from double-leg to single-leg stance (eyes closed), simulating the initiation of an SLS. Normalised SEMG amplitudes 200-300 ms after weight-transfer initiation were compared between injured and non-injured sides, and correlated to the TSP scores for the SLS. Peak absolute SEMG amplitudes during 5 TSP test movements were also compared between sides. RESULTS: At weight-transfer initiation, muscle activity was lower in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. Low muscle activity correlated moderately to worse TSP scores for the SLS for the gluteus medius (rs=-0.56, p=0.03), and gastrocnemius muscles (rs=-0.56, p=0.02). Median peak absolute amplitude during TSP movements was lower in the quadriceps, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. CONCLUSIONS: The altered patterns of muscle activity at weight-transfer initiation, correlations between lower activity at movement initiation and altered movement patterns during SLS and the altered peak amplitudes during TSP movements together indicate alterations in sensorimotor control that may contribute to the observed altered movement patterns. Future studies will determine if exercises targeting muscle activity initiation should complement customary ACL injury rehabilitation.","2016","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","e000131","","1","2","","BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28890799 PMCID: PMC5566258","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28890799","","Anterior cruciate ligament; Exercise rehabilitation; Muscle; Neuromuscular; Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UTε). RESULTS: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UTϵ. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UTϵ was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. CONCLUSION: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UTϵ and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise.","2017-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","701-707","","3","45","","Am J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28272925","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28272925","","allograft tendons; Allografts; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; knee ligament reconstruction; peroneus longus; semitendinosus; Tendons; Tensile Strength; tibialis anterior; tibialis posterior; Transplantation, Homologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. PURPOSE: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. RESULTS: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0° in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35° anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35° anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40° proximally in the coronal plane and 20° to 40° anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40° proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20° proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0° in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CONCLUSION: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35° anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40° proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20° proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0° in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The risk of tunnel convergence with the ACL and PCL femoral tunnels can be reduced by adjusting the orientation of the FCL and PLT tunnels and the sMCL and POL tunnels, respectively.","2017-03","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","563-569","","3","45","","Am J Sports Med","Multiple Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnels","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27872126","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27872126","","Anterior Cruciate Ligament; femur; Femur; Humans; knee; Knee Joint; multiple ligament reconstructions; Norway; Plastic Surgery Procedures; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; tunnel convergence; tunnel orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Seven pairs of peroneus longus (PL) and ten pairs of peroneus brevis (PB) tendons were procured from human cadavers. The diameter of each allograft was measured. The left side of each allograft was IR at 1.5-2.5 Mrad, whereas the right side was kept aseptic and NI. The allografts were thawed, kept wet with saline, and attached in a single-strand fashion to custom freeze grips using liquid nitrogen. A preload of 10 N was then applied and, after it had reached steady state, the allografts were pulled at 4 cm/sec. The parameters recorded were the displacement and force. RESULTS: The elongation at the peak load was 10.3±2.3 mm for the PB NI side and 13.5±3.3 mm for the PB IR side. The elongation at the peak load was 17.4±5.3 mm for the PL NI side and 16.3±2.0 mm for the PL IR side. For PL, the ultimate load was 2,091.6±148.7 N for NI and 2,122.8±380.0 N for IR. The ultimate load for the PB tendons was 1,485.7±209.3 N for NI and 1,318.4±296.9 N for the IR group. The ultimate stress calculations for PL were 90.3±11.3 MPa for NI and 94.8±21.0 MPa for IR. For the PB, the ultimate stress was 82.4±19.0 MPa for NI and 72.5±16.6 MPa for the IR group. The structural stiffness was 216.1±59.0 N/mm for the NI PL and 195.7±51.4 N/mm for the IR side. None of these measures were significantly different between the NI and IR groups. The structural stiffness was 232.1±45.7 N/mm for the NI PB and 161.9±74.0 N/mm for the IR side, and this was the only statistically significant difference found in this study (P=0.034). CONCLUSION: Our statistical comparisons found no significant differences in terms of elongation, ultimate load, or ultimate stress between IR and NI PB and PL tendons. Only the PB structural stiffness was affected by irradiation. Thus, sterilizing allografts at 1.5-2.5 Mrad of gamma irradiation does not cause major alterations in the tendons' biomechanical properties while still providing a suitable amount of sterilization for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","2016","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","123-127","","","7","","Open Access J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27695371 PMCID: PMC5033496","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27695371","","ACL reconstruction; allograft; sterilization; tissue banking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, because this technique uses suture loops and cortical suspension buttons for graft fixation, it has mostly been limited to looped graft constructs (e.g., hamstring autograft, peroneus longus allograft). Quadriceps tendon autograft offers several advantages in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but, until recently, has not been compatible with suture-loop and cortical suspensory fixation.

Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T1ρ and T2 mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated. Noyes Score (NS) clinical grades of cartilage lesions were noted at both times and correlated with relaxation times. Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T1ρ times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T1ρ increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T1ρ and T2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

DESIGN: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1ρ and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1ρ or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1ρ or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. RESULTS: Higher baseline SSD T1ρ posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1ρ pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year. CONCLUSION: T1ρ and T2 of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS after injury and both KOOS and Marx after reconstruction.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 24 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft and endobutton fixation. Results of ACL reconstruction were assessed via physical examination. Donor site morbidity of the foot and ankle after tendon-harvesting was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot-and-Ankle Society (AOFAS) for ankle-hindfoot score and Visual Analogue Score-Foot Ankle (VAS-FA). Isokinetic testing for the ankle was performed in 10 voluntary patients after surgery. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Regarding the latest follow-up, anterior drawer tests of ankle showed normal findings in 83.3%, and 1+ anterior laxity in 16.7% of all patients. Mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS scores were 100.0 ± 0.0 and 96.0 ± 9.6, respectively at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.06). Mean pre- and postoperative VAS-FA scores were 99.7 ± 1.1 and 95.4 ± 12.0, respectively at - 13-month follow-up (p = 0.09). At 7-month follow-up by isokinetic testing, peak torques of eversion and inversion were significantly lower on the harvested ankle compared with the contralateral ankle at both velocities (60 degrees/second and 120 degrees/second, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on overall findings in the present study, the authors could not recommend the peroneus longus tendon as the first option of donor graft for ACL reconstruction due to the several morbidities particularly in the first 12 months after the operation. However, the peroneus longus tendon may be the option after other graft harvestings for the ligament reconstruction, which needs several tendon grafts in a patient with multi-directional instability of the knee due to some specific situation such as a traumatic knee dislocation.","2015-06","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","555-560","","6","98","","J Med Assoc Thai","The Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with the Peroneus Longus Tendon","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26219159","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26219159","","Ankle; Ankle Joint; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Foot; Humans; Knee Dislocation; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. METHODS: Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameter <7 mm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3 years after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. RESULTS: The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2 mm on average (range, 6.0-6.5 mm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6 mm (range, 9.5-10.0 mm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80-90).

METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations and 10° axial/30° coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. RESULTS: Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10° axial/30° coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20° axial/20° coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater.","2016-01","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","195-200","","1","24","","Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25288339","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25288339","","Adult; Aged; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Articular; Cadaver; Female; Femur; Humans; Knee injuries; Knee Joint; Ligaments; Male; Middle Aged; Surgery; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this controlled clinical trial, 375 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction arthroscopically using hamstring tendons in the orthopedic clinics of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2010 and 2011 were selected. Fifteen patients were included because their hamstring tendon diameter was lower than 8 mm and peroneus longus was added. After 6 months, the patients were followed using ""Kistler force plate"" to detect 3D kinematics and kinetics of the ankles and spatiotemporal walking parameters. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between both operated and non-operated ankles in flexion/extension range of motion (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the moments of both ankles in sagittal and coronal planes (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference between the moments of both ankles in the transverse plane (P = 0.006).

METHODS: Morphometric measurements of PLT segments were taken from computed tomography (CT) images and compared with results obtained using calipers. PLT were tested to failure at a rate of 100% length/s. Mechanical properties and failure mode were recorded. RESULTS: PLT width and thickness (P < .001 for both) measured by calipers were significantly lower than those taken from CT images. Thirty-five (83%) specimens failed by avulsion fracture from the patella, 1 failed mid-ligament, and 6 failed by tibial fracture. Dog weight and PLT length had the strongest Pearson's r value when correlated with load at failure (r = 0.73, 0.81, respectively).

The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL. One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus longus and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. METHOD: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg. As the knee joint is unstable following the use of this method, it is recommended to find a new method of ACL reconstruction to improve the function of this ligament after reconstruction.","2013-12","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","526-531","","6","20","","Knee","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23978326","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23978326","","ACL reconstructed; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Compressive Strength; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gait; Humans; Joint Instability; Kinematic; Kinetic; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Quadriceps Muscle; Reference Values; Risk Assessment; Tendons; Tensile Strength; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. RESULTS: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N).

These are the doubled tibialis anterior (TA), doubled tibialis posterior (TP), and doubled peroneus longus (PL) tendons. TYPE OF STUDY: A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. METHODS: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. RESULTS: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm2, 48 mm2, and 37 mm2, respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/mm) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. CONCLUSIONS: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources. The biomechanical properties observed for the TA, TP, and PL were noted in specimens despite an average age of 78.3 years.","2003-12","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","1091-1096","","10","19","","Arthroscopy","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 14673451","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14673451","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cadaver; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Tendons; Transplantation, Homologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electron microscopic analysis","The American Journal of Sports Medicine","","0363-5465","10.1177/036354659502300213","","We studied human anterior cruciate ligament allograft specimens by quantitative electron microscopy to analyze their collagen fibril populations. The specimens were procured at the time of second-look arthroscopy from the superficial region of the midzone of the anterior cruciate ligament grafts after synovial clearage. The grafts used for the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were from fresh-frozen allogenic Achilles, tibialis anterior or posterior, or peroneus longus or brevis tendons and had been implanted 3 to 96 months previously. By 12 months after surgery, the anterior cruciate ligament allografts consisted predominantly of small-diameter collagen fibrils (30 to 80 nm), which resulted in a unimodal pattern in the collagen fibril profile. The number of large-diameter fibrils (90 to 140 nm) within the allogenic tendon grafts had decreased. This predominance of small-diameter collagen fibrils persisted in almost all specimens older than 12 months. The anterior cruciate ligament allografts had collagen fibril profiles that did not resemble normal tendon grafts or normal anterior cruciate ligaments, even several years after surgery.","1995","2025-10-18 11:51:14","2025-10-18 11:51:14","","203-208; discussion 209","","2","23","","Am J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 7778706","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7778706","","Achilles Tendon; Actin Cytoskeleton; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Biopsy; Collagen; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Reoperation; Tendons; Transplantation, Homologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
